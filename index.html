                                <p style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>Painting description: &nbsp;</strong>This painting highlights the heiau, or temple, and the surrounding landscape.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>The background features blue skies with a moon rising on the upper right below a snow-capped mountain. The painting glows with a dawning or twilight light, like the morning sun peeking out to greet the night moon. The&nbsp;temple sits on a brown barren hill. &nbsp;The rugged and rough terrain is evidence of a dry and thirsty land. The temple dominants the hillside. It is a tall open-aired, 3-walled rock structure with three tiered levels.&nbsp;</p><p>During an early morning ceremony,&nbsp;&nbsp;65 men on the&nbsp;lower terrace and 56 men on the second terrace sit in a row side by side across each terrace platform, which spans the entire open-west side of the heiau and are like two large steps.&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven men stand on the third, top terrace or platform which is like an open, flat roof covering the entire heiau.&nbsp; A kahuna, (priest) wearing white tapa cloth presides over the ceremony. He stands on the third main terrace at the south end of the temple, facing the men on the lower terraces. Both of his hands are raised.</p><p>One large thatched house is located on the north (left) on the main terrace along with two other small thatched houses located 50 steps south of the large thatched house. &nbsp;Between the large and small thatched houses is a tall statue (12 feet high) of the war-god ku. &nbsp;Close to the 16-foot rock wall at the south of the temple are eight wooden statues about 10 feet in height set in a row from east to west.&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the statues is a large, 15-foot altar covered in white tapa cloth. &nbsp;At the far north below the temple are four men facing the temple holding&nbsp;long&nbsp;spears.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>Herb K. Kane</p><p style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>Text:&nbsp;</strong><span style="line-height: 20px;">The stone heiau at Pu‘ukoholä is one of the last major sacred structures built in Hawai‘i before outside influences altered traditional life permanently. Constructed in 1790–91 by Kameha­meha I, this heiau, or temple, played a crucial role in the ruler’s ascendancy.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">By 1790, Kamehameha, whom many believed destined to rule all of the Hawaiian islands, had invaded and conquered Maui, Läna‘i, and Moloka‘i. Yet he was not able to lay full claim to his home island of Hawai‘i because of opposition from his chief rival and cousin, Keöua Küahu‘ula. While on Moloka‘i, Kamehameha learned that Keöua was invading his territory. Kamehameha sent his aunt to seek direction from the prophet Käpoükahi, who told her that Kamehameha would conquer all the islands if he built a large&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">heiau dedicated to his family war god Kükä‘ilimoku (Kü) atop Pu‘ukoholä—Whale Hill—at Kawaihae.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">Kamehameha set to work immediately. According to the pro­phecy, the builders had to follow rigid guidelines in order to please Kü the war god. To ensure perfection, the prophet Kä­poükahi served as the royal architect. Thousands of men camped out on the hills for nearly a year to work on the massive structure. Because the heiau had to be constructed of water-worn lava rocks, it is believed that rocks came from the seaside valley of Pololü. Workers formed a human chain at least 20 miles long and transported the rocks hand to hand to the top of Pu‘ukoholä. Kamehameha himself&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">labored with the others. When news of the war temple reached the rival chiefs, they decided they must attack while Kamehameha and his war­­riors were occupied. At the least, the rivals would interfere with the ritually specified construction process, and Kü would be displeased. At best, the invasion would eli­mi­nate Kamehameha and the threat he posed to his rivals. The chiefs of Maui, Läna‘i, and Moloka‘i reconquered their islands and, joined by the chiefs of Kaua‘i and O‘ahu, sailed to attack Kamehameha. Kamehameha counterattacked, routed the invaders, and resumed work.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">In the summer of 1791 the heiau was finished. Kamehameha&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">invited his cousin Keöua Küahu‘ula to the dedication ceremonies. Perhaps awed by the power of the heiau and its god, perhaps&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">resigned to the ascendancy of his cousin, Keöua Küahu‘ula came willingly to what would be his doom. When he arrived there was&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">a scuffle and, whether Kamehameha intended it or not, Keöua&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">and almost all of his companions were slain. The body of Keöua was carried to the heiau and offered as the principal sacrifice to Kü.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;">The death of Keöua Küahu‘ula ended all opposition on the island&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">of Hawai‘i, and the prophecy began to come true. By 1810, through conquest and treaties, Kamehameha the Great, builder of Pu‘ukoholä Heiau, was the revered king of all the Hawaiian Islands.</span></p>

Three long, narrow&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20px;">terraced steps cross the side that faces the sea, opening the interior to view from canoes floating offshore and, presumably, intimidating any attackers. At the time the temple was </span><span style="line-height: 20px;">in use, there were thatched houses and </span><span style="line-height: 20px;">an altar for the ruling chief and his priests. Wooden images of Hawaiian gods stood on the platform and terraces. After Kameha­meha I died in 1819, his son abolished the religious traditions of the past. Most temples, in­cluding Pu‘ukoholä Heiau, were abandoned. Only the heiaus that served as a mausoleums were maintained.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>Illustration description: </strong>&nbsp;Like the color painting, artist and historian Herb K.

He stands with straight posture, like a soldier with a firm muscular build, and holds a 10-foot jagged-tip spear. He wears a feathered &nbsp;red, yellow and white cape. The cape measures 5 to 6 feet in height and about 4 feet in width. &nbsp;His headdress is a crescent shape and about 2-3 feet in height. Shaped like a C, it curves downwards from the front to the back of his head. It is red, except for the top curved section that faces upwards, which is yellow. &nbsp;</p><p style="line-height: 20px;">He wears a feathered malo, which is a loincloth worn in ceremonies. The malo is red with a yellow outline and includes a sash that goes around his mid torso and across his left shoulder. A rectangular flap of the same color and material extends from the bottom of the sash, where his belly button may be, to about mid thigh.&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height: 20px;">Around his neck is a whale tooth pendant shaped like a tongue or hook with thick threads of black human hair braided to hold the pendant. It is symbolic of ”one who speaks with authority.”&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height: 20px;">He has line tattoos around his right bicep and upper right thigh. The bicep design is potentially representative of the mountains and water. The thigh design looks like layers of triangles alternating like pin wheels and is potentially incomplete at the bottom row.&nbsp;</p><p style="line-height: 20px;">He wears open-toed sandals of woven twine that wrap around his ankles, the soles of which could protect his feet from walking on sharp jagged lava rocks.</p><p style="line-height: 20px;"><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>Herb K.

Starting from the farmost western island, they are Ni‘ihau, Kaua‘i, O‘ahu, Moloka‘i, Lana‘i, Maui, Kaho‘olawe and Hawai‘i. Hawai‘i is the largest island in the chain. A red dot on the north point of the island of Hawai'i represents where Pu‘ukohola Heiau NHS is located.<br></span></p><p style="line-height: 20px;"><span style="line-height: 1.4285;"><strong>Text:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">From childhood, Kamehameha seemed destined for greatness. With the appearance of a bright, white-tailed star (possibly Halley’s Comet) in 1758 Hawaiian seers predicted the emergence of a great leader. Kameha­meha, “The Lonely One,” was born around that time in the Kohala district on the northwestern tip of the island </span><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">of Hawai‘i.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">Son of a high chief and a princess, Kame­ha­meha began training as a child to join the ranks of </span><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">nä ali‘i koa, the chiefly warriors. By young adulthood he was tall and muscular—every bit the powerful warrior his family had expected. In 1782 at the death of his uncle, Kalan­i‘o­pu‘u, who ruled the island of Hawai‘i, Kameha­meha inherited land on the northern part of the island and was given custody of his family’s war god, Kükä‘ilimoku. As he gained power, he intended to one day rule all of the Hawaiian Islands.</span></p><p>Uni­fi­cation, in his view, would bring peace <span style="line-height: 1.4285;">to the continually war­ring chiefdoms throughout the islands. His rival for control of his home island was his cousin Keöua Küahu­‘ula, with whom he battled indecisively in the 1780s. In 1790 Kame­ha­meha successfully invaded Maui, Läna‘i, and Moloka‘i with the aid of John Young and Isaac Davis, stranded British sailors who </span><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">be­came his close advisors. The next year he re­turned to Hawai‘i and defended his lands against the chiefs of O‘ahu and Kaua‘i in a naval battle off the coast near the Waipi‘o Valley. The island of Hawai‘i finally came under his full control when his cousin Keöua was slain on the beach below Pu‘uko­holä Heiau.</span></p><p>In 1794 Kamehameha reconquered Maui, Läna‘i, and Moloka‘i. Victory in a bloody battle on O‘ahu ended opposition there in 1795. Fifteen years later, peaceful negotiations finally brought him Kaua‘i. By 1810 Kame­hameha had established his island kingdom.</p><p>Kamehameha appointed governors to administer each island. He ruled according to Hawaiian tradition but outlawed some of the more severe practices such as human sacrifices. With John Young as his trading agent, he parlayed the sandalwood trade into great wealth for himself and his people. Kameha­meha remained king of the islands until his death in 1819. The Hawaiian monarchy he founded lasted until 1893.</p>

During his rise to power, Kamehameha I had four main battle chiefs from his home island in addition to his foreign advisors John Young and Isaac Davis. These chiefs led armies composed of nä ali‘i koa and nä koa.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.4285;">Nä ali‘i koa were a highly trained, organized, and disciplined force with centuries of tradition behind them. These elite warriors were sons of varying degrees of ali‘i (chiefs) and were trained by personal tutors to increase their battle skills and proficiency. Kamehameha himself was trained from age seven or eight, not surprising for a child of such promise—and whose family deity was the war god Kükä‘ilimoku (left).</span></p><p>Because of their high status, nä ali‘i koa did not train with the maka‘äinana (commoners), who were taken away from the land and their tasks only in time of war to serve in the ranks of nä koa. Orga­nized military training was a luxury afforded to a select few, and for most young men, duty meant tending to farming, fishing, and other daily needs. At the call of the kälaimoku (a rank equivalent to prime minister), nä koa rose from all classes and from all regions of the islands except from the kauwä, society’s outcast class. Kauwä could not mingle even with commoners; they were sacrificed in the heiau when no lawbreakers or war prisoners were available.</p><p><strong>Illustration description:</strong>&nbsp;In this image, the war god Kü is depicted in the form of a reddish-brown, feathered deity.

This older temple was nearly as big as Pu‘ukoholä Heiau but not so finely crafted. During the rule of Kamehameha I, John Young helped the king convert this temple into a fort.</p>

He became a trusted military adviser to Kamehameha I. Young served as governor of Hawai‘i Island after Kamehameha designated him an ali‘i nui (high chief), giving him the name ‘Olohana. Young married Ka‘oana‘eha, the niece of Kamehameha. His granddaughter was Queen Emma, wife of Kamehameha IV. Today Young’s homestead site has the remains of the oldest known European-style house in Hawaii.</p><p><strong>Illustration text: </strong>Artist‘s conception of John Young‘s homestead. The three foreground structures show native Hawaiian styles: terraces, paving, platforms, and mounds of dry-laid masonry. Those in the rear show Western styling: walls of stone set in mud mortar. Today only a few walls and foundations remain.</p><p><strong>Illustration description:</strong>&nbsp;The homestead is made up of 6 thatched houses. &nbsp;In the front right of the sketch is a small house. The sides of the house are surrounded by a partial wide rock wall. A man stands on the platform of the rock wall and is not much shorter than the steep roof of the house. He holds a spear. Directly behind the small house is another larger house built with a wooden fence along part of the outside perimeter of the homestead.&nbsp; The house has a thatched steep roof, but has only columns and no walls enclosing the structure. &nbsp;Across from this house on the other side of the homestead's perimeter is another thatched house of a similar size. &nbsp;This house is built on a rock platform with a wooden fence surrounding part of the house's walls on the inside of the homestead and a lower rock wall on that side of the homestead's perimeter. Behind and to the side of this house is a larger house built with a thatched roof and walls made of rocks. It has a small window in what could be a second story. &nbsp;To the right of this house and in the back of the homestead is the house site of John Young. It has a thatched roof and walls made of rocks.&nbsp; The front entrance of the house is covered with a thatched open lanai in which the entrance door is located.&nbsp; The entrance faces west towards the ocean.&nbsp; Between this house and the two-story house, two men stand in the background.&nbsp; On the other side of the house a horse is tied to a pole. &nbsp;Six feet from John Young's House Site is a a potion of another thatched house.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>Herb K.
