The Wall of Names can be seen in the distance at far left.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Photo description:</strong> On a fall day, the trees in the background of this photo are in the full range of color from brilliant orange to yellow, and red. The sky is blue. On the right side of the photo starting in the background and coming towards us in the foreground are two large gray stone walls that run parallel and curve on an angle. Nestled within the middle section of these two walls, is a concrete and glass building, which is the park's visitor center. To the left of the structure is an open field of green, yellow and brown grasses. To the right of the structure is a parking lot in the upper right hand corner with a few cars, some surrounding trees, and another concrete and glass building in the distance. This building is the park's Learning Center.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Photo credit:</strong> copyright by Paul Murdoch Architects and Biolinia</p>

                                <p>September 11, 2001, morning. Four commercial airliners are hijacked by al Qaeda terrorists in a planned attack against the United States. Two are flown into the World Trade Center’s twin towers in New York City. A third is flown into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. A fourth plane, United Flight 93, a Boeing 757 bound from Newark, New Jersey, for San Francisco, California, is delayed 25 minutes before takeoff.</p><p>After 46 minutes flying, when over eastern Ohio, hijackers in first class attack at &nbsp;9 28 a.m., incapacitating the captain and first officer. Hijackers turn Flight 93 southeast, headed for Washington DC, most likely the US Capitol (below).</p><p>Just before 10 am the plane is seen flying low and erratically over southwestern Pennsylvania. At 10 O 3 a.m. it crashes, upside down, at 563 miles per hour into this Somerset County field. There are no survivors. All 33 passengers, seven crew members, and four hijackers are killed.</p>

Newark is located in New Jersey on the east coast and the right-hand side middle of the map. Four minutes later at 8:46 A.M., Flight 11 strikes the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. The bold red line representing Flight 93 continues westward over Pennsylvania. At 9:03 A.M., Flight 175 strikes the South Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City. As the bold red line crosses into Ohio at 9:28 A.M., the terrorists aboard Flight 93 take over the plane. Flight 93 deviates from its planned route to San Francisco indicated by a black dotted line and turns sharply to the south then southeast making a U turn over northeast Ohio located on the upper far left of the map. Flight 93 continues southeast toward Washington D.C. At 9:37 A.M., Flight 77 strikes the Pentagon. Flight 93 continues southeast flying over West Virginia's panhandle and enters Pennsylvania. By 9:57 A.M., the passengers and crew struggle to take control of the plane. This struggle continues for six minutes ending at 10:03 A.M. with the plane crashing at 563 miles per hour in Somerset County, Pennsylvania located almost directly in center of the map. The plane was only 18 minutes flying time to the U.S. Capitol. This distance is indicated on the map by a black dotted line ending with a dot marking Washington, D.C.

The building is Neoclassical in style, inspired by Greek and Roman designs. Sitting on a slight hilltop, the building has tall columns, white marble and symmetrical shapes throughout. In the center of the building and adorning this landmark is a three tiered, domed roof, which rises above the rest of the building’s rooftop. On top of the dome is a figure, which is known as the Statue of Freedom. In the foreground lies a majestic lawn of grass and trees. In the background are other Federal buildings. The U.S. Capitol Building is home of the United States Congress, making it the most likely target of Flight 93.<strong> </strong><strong>Photo credit: </strong>Copyright by Library of Congress, Carol Highsmith Collection</p>

                                <p><strong>Text: </strong>What happened on board Flight 93—why it crashed here and why it did not strike its target—revealed itself as a story of heroic action. When the terrorist hijackers took over the plane, passengers and crew began phoning family, friends, and authorities to report the hijacking. Their calls—13 people placed 37 calls—told them of the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks. Their plane, they now realized, was part of a planned attack. Passengers and crew then made a collective decision, by vote, to rush the terrorists and try to retake the plane.</p><p>Additional text and three photo descriptions follow:</p><ol><li><strong>Photo caption:</strong> The smoke plume from the crash explosion was photographed by a nearby resident. September 11, 2001, marked the first time that terrorists used commercial airliners as weapons to destroy symbolic targets, commit mass murder, and spread fear. Al Qaeda had targeted the World Trade Center, commerce, Pentagon, military; and U.S. Capitol government. <strong>Photo description: </strong>On the far right of this photo is a large red barn and smaller red outbuilding. On the far left located upon a tree lined hilltop is a second barn, white in color. Central to the image is a billowing dark gray ominous cloud of smoke rising in a clear blue cloudless sky. <strong>Photo credit: </strong>Valencia McClattachey<br></li><li><strong>Photo caption:</strong> Hay bales covered with tributes from the families of the passengers and crew formed an early, informal memorial even as the FBI recovery work and search for evidence continued at the crash site. <strong>Photo description</strong>: This photo depicts tribute items left by family members of the passengers and crew of Flight 93. Running diagonally across the image right to left is a row of hay bales. Placed on these hay bales are a vast variety of tributes: flowers, wreaths, photographs, stuffed animals and wooden angels. A yellow tape barrier is in the far left. An American Flag has been placed almost within the center of the tributes and hay bales. In the distance is the crash site where men and women search for evidence. Past the field, in the background are bluish hills and a green forest.&nbsp;<strong>Photo credit</strong>: copyright by James Bee&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Photo description: </strong>Underneath the text and photos on the top half of the brochure is another photograph of the recovery scene. Six people, two women and four men, are at the crash site. Four of these individuals wear white hazmat suits that include high-waisted white paints and white foot booties covering their shoes. The other two wear yellow hazmat suites that cover their upper and lower bodies and blue booties that cover their shoes. They are near the crater at the crash site of Flight 93. Mounds of dirt are in the background along with a scorched tree line. Scattered debris surrounds the group. With the exception of one woman, they look towards the crash site. The other woman walks away from the site. She wears a protective mask. There is a yellow tape barrier in the foreground lying in the grass.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>Photo credit: </strong>copyright by Dale Sparks<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>

                                <p><strong>Text: </strong>Recovered from the crash site, the cockpit voice recorder captured the shouts, thumps, crashes, and breaking of glass and plates. The 9/11 Commission reported that the hijackers, although remaining in control of the plane, must have judged that the passengers and crew were mere seconds from overcoming them. To continued sounds of the counterattack, Flight 93 crashed into this field.</p><p>The crash site is 18 minutes flying time from Washington, DC. The action of unarmed passengers and crew thwarted and defeated the terrorists’ plan.</p><p>Additional text for three photos and their descriptions follow:</p><p><strong>Three-photo caption:</strong> The first volunteer fire fighters on the scene and local residents stand by the smoldering crater 15 minutes after the crash. At the direction of the coroner, the crater was backfilled. A piece of fuselage was one of the largest objects recovered. The cockpit voice recorder gave details of the diverted flight.</p><p>The cockpit voice recorder became important evidence for the FBI in this, its largest-ever investigation. This was the only voice recorder recovered from the four hijacked aircraft to yield information. This “black box” gave critical information about the aircraft’s final moments and the struggle for control. Other evidence found here would enable the FBI to trace how the terrorist attacks were financed.</p><ol><li><strong>Photo description—Firefighters and Residents at the Crash Site: </strong>Local residents and firefighters stand behind the impact site.

The section of the plane lies on green leaves and branches of hemlock. The section includes two distinct window portals and a section of the plane wall and ceiling above them. It looks as if this section was a crumpled piece of paper that has been unfolded. The metal material is brownish gray, probably from the heat and fire. It was the largest section of the plane to be found.<strong> Photo credit: </strong>FBI&nbsp;<br></li><li><strong>Photo description—Voice Recorder: </strong>The cockpit voice recorder that was recovered at the crash site sits among the dirt and debris.
