                                <p>The vow by Francesco Sforza (1401 – 1466) in 1451 to the people of Milan to establish “a large and solemn hospital” was transformed in the decree proclaimed on 1st April 1456, six years after his triumphant entrance in the city – an event that marked the end of the ruling dynasty of the Viscontis demise and the demise of Communitas ambrosiana (1447-1450), which had reduced the city in misery. In subjecting themselves to the new lord, the people of Milan hoped to obtain peace, stability and prosperity. They called upon the Sforza not to focus exclusively on strengthening his political and military power , symbolically represented by the reconstruction of the devastated Visconti castle at Giovia Gate (currently Castello Sforzesco), but also on reinvigorating Milan’s vocation in providing assistance to the needy as part of a tradition the city had developed over the centuries.</p><br>

The layout involved two crossbars, one for men and the other for female patients, developing within a square, each defining four square-shaped inner courtyards. The two larger blocks were thus connected by a large rectangular courtyard at the centre of which stood a church. The project underwent significant changes as the original architectural solutions had to be adapted to the rigours of the local climate and also scaled down as a consequence of the chronic lack of funds that slowed down work to such an extent that construction was terminated but a few centuries later.</p>

The bombs that rained down between 13 and 16 August 1943 brought down part of the façade along via Festa del Perdono, destroyed the Central Courtyard, including the portico, and heavily damaged the lateral cloisters.</p><br>

The initial phase of the work focused on the rearrangement of the 19th-century wing – the teaching wing – where a more creative approach was possible because the artistic value there was less significant than in the rest of the monument. The reconstruction of the Central Courtyard proved to be far more challenging and was ultimately terminated in 1958 with the inauguration of the Università degli Studi. The most delicate part of the reconstruction started in the 1960 and centred around the 15th-century wing, with a special focus on the four cloisters. The restoration work in this part of the edifice, as well as the reconstruction ex novo of several sections, relied on a sound methodology based on the rigorous analysis of contemporary documentation and iconography that allowed for the preservation of Filarete’s original construction patterns, which continue to provide the benchmark for any restoration work that is required. Architect Grassi’s work officially terminated on 31 October 1984, with the handing of the Crossing to the university.</p>

                                <p>The mortuary service at Ospedale Maggiore had been authorised right from the outset with the 1456 foundational papal bull issued by pope Pius II (1456) and provided within the hospital premises soon after the hospital began operations (1473). The area reserved as a burial ground, the Sepolcreto, expanded rapidly not only because those who died in hospitals were generally not allowed to be buried in the city’s parish cemeteries but also because those who were buried in the hospital grounds were granted indulgence. On 7 May 1473, the Ca’ Granda Chapter decided to build a small wall, by the Annunciata chapel originally located in the northwestern side of the present-day Central Courtyard, serving to delimit a space for the burial of the poor who died in hospital. The bones were successively laid in the original burial ground, probably underneath the chapel itself.</p><p>From the middle ages through the 18th century, the dead were buried naked or wrapped in sack-shaped shrouds in mass graves, half-a-metre deep, containing up to a dozen bodies. After about two or three years, the remains were dug up and placed in the charnel houses of cemeteries. When a particularly serious epidemic broke out, the burial period had to be reduced drastically due to lack of space and the number of bodies buried in a single mass grave spiralled out of measure thereby interrupting the natural process of decomposition. <br></p><p>During the 16th century, as the number of patients, and therefore of deaths, grew, the lawn in the unbuilt part of the hospital grounds was turned into a paupers’ grave, the foppone or “pit” in the Milanese dialect, were the bodies were buried. The foppone was periodically emptied and the bones placed in the hospital’s burial grounds, which were known as the brugna, the Milanese for churchyard.</p><p>When the Carcano complex was constructed (1624-1649), a new burial ground was created under the crypt of the Annunciata church. Known successively as the ‘Old Brugna,’ it remained active until mid-17th century. Other sepulchres – known as the New Brugna – were constructed along the Naviglio side (now via Francesco Sforza) and remained in use until 1697 or even later. In fact recent C14 testing on several surface samples show that these burial grounds were in use up to the 18th century.</p><p>The rising number of corpses and their slow decomposition discharged so much gas as to make the stay at the hospital absolutely impossible. As temporary documentation show, hospital staff and local residents filed angry protest to the Health Tribunal. It was only starting from the last decade of the 17th-century that the decision was taken to build a new cemetery outside the city walls. Known as Nuovi sepolcri (“New Sepulchres”), and now as Rotonda della Besana, the burial ground was established in July 1697.<br>The burial grounds within the hospital premises, however, were never totally emptied out. In 1692, 65 out of the 66 pits were opened, but the exhumation of the remains was interrupted following a controversy between two funeral homes. But the bones that had been recovered were buried in pits dug in the parvis before the hospital chapel. During the siege laid by the Austrians to Milan’s city centre, which had been taken over by the rebels during the insurrection of 1848, the Milanese who were killed in the clashes – the patriot and philosopher Carlo Cattaneo counted some 300 dead and wounded – were temporarily buried in the principal burial ground after the area under the central pits had been emptied and the subsisting remains scattered in the lateral ones. The bodies of the 150 who fell – maybe even more – were then exhumed in 1895 and reburied in the bone house under the monument made by Giuseppe Grandi at Porta Vittoria dedicated to the Cinque Giornate (“The Five Days”) as the insurrection came to be known.</p><p><hr></p><br>

                                <p>Currently kept on the wall of the entrance hall of the Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, the large painting has been studied thoroughly and featured extensively in the literature focusing on the history of the hospital and its art collections.</p><p>While the work is traditionally known as the Feast of Forgiveness in the Courtyard of Ospedale Maggiore, recent studies have revealed that the famous feast, celebrated in the streets of Milan in front of the hospital, is not really the theme of the painting, which is actually an illustration providing an overview of the medical care activities carried out within the hospital. <br></p><p>The sprawling space of the Central Courtyard offers the painter an effective artistic expedient to represent, one alongside the other, the various episodes of hospital life: impecunious patients beg for alms along the small boulevard leading to the Santissima Annunciata church set against the backdrop of a funeral procession; state carriages carry wealthy folk into the hospital, while more modest ones transport goods and the sick. On the foreground, on the left, opulently dressed gentlemen – possibly the hospital deputies – discuss, while an obsequious functionary is handed a reel; behind them is a rather curious character: elegantly attired, equipped with walking stick and hat, he appear to be a proportional dwarf, moving around in the crowd begging. On the right of the painting a group of wet nurses lull and breastfeed babies, while alongside them a man hand over a foundling to an old man with crutches carrying two large keys from his belt, probably the hospital caretaker. Several ecclesiastics, regular and laymen, make their appearance in the painting’s various scenes, which together count over 200 figures.</p><p>From a strictly artistic point of view, the painting presents numerous inconsistencies in terms of quality. For example, strongly realistic figures – the hospital deputies could be, in all effects, real portraits – come alongside wellmade ones, like the wet nurses on the right, and evidently more modest ones. The uncertain perspective of the architecture, in addition, naively distorts the columns on the left-hand side of the portico.</p><p>Made probably between the 17th- and 18th-centuries, the painting was made after the cour d’honneur, designed by Francesco Maria Richini (1584-1658), had been completed. It is particularly interesting from an historical point of view because it provides an unusual documentation of what the hospital looked like soon after the restructuring carried out by Richini. (The small balustrade crowning the Annunciata chapel, for example, no longer exists). It also significantly provides a record of the local colour and costumes in the period marking the passage between the Spanish and the Austrian domination. It was to this painting that Francesco Gonin (1808-1889) sought inspiration from when he designed the clothes for the characters of The Betrothed, the literary masterpiece he illustrated, anachronistically incurring into error considering that the novel by Alessandro Manzoni was set in the years between 1628 and 1630. The painting, in addition, belongs to a flourishing Milanese popular tradition that in the course of the 17th-century produced a flurry of works depicting city life, as clearly shown in the many paintings of the Borromeo collection. <br></p><p>As for the date of the painting, a singular coincidence has been brought to light. Under the portico on the second floor is a young man affected by dwarfism but nevertheless perfectly proportioned. The remains of a person with such characteristics were found in the ricetto most likely going back to a period between the end of the 16th-century and the early decades of the 18th. Unfortunately no records exist in the archives testifying to when the painting came into the hospital’s possession or from where it came. The painting has been attributed in the past to Sebastiano Giuliense, better known as Sebastianone, a genre painter who lived and worked in Milan from at least 1673, and who, judging by art collection inventories of the time, appears to have enjoyed a degree of success during the 18th-century. Nevertheless the studies carried out so far have only partially shed light on the personality of this artist. The few works that have been definitely ascribed to him, in addition to the descriptions of his works available in collection inventories, show him as a portraitist and author of scenes involving beggars – following the example of Pietro Bellotti – and not as a painter belonging to the Bambocciati with a penchant for depicting peasant rogues.</p><p></p><hr><p></p><br>

                                                                                                <p>The number of bequeathals for Ospedale Maggiore increased significantly starting from the second- half of the 15th-century. Donations came not only from wealthy citizens but also from the poorer segments of the populations. The poor, while able to give precious little, showed compassion and the strong will to contribute to the running and development of the Ca’ Granda, which had emerged, along with the Duomo, as the symbol of ‘Milaneseness.’ Designed in a layout consisting of three main bodies, the Ca’ Granda was left unfinished for a long period of time, until, that is, a very conspicuous bequeathal gave to the construction its long-awaited turnaround. In 1621 Giovanni Pietro Carcano wrote a will, which became executive in 1624, the year of his death. </p><p>The legacy he left was staggering in its consistency. Carcano, who had become immensely rich from the wool trade and the banking business he had set up, left to his underage son all his possessions, establishing, in addition, that half of the income generated by the estate – worth an astounding 1,622,000 liras – be devolved to the Ca’ Granda until his son came of age, after 16 years. Thanks to Carcano, who is remembered as the Ospedale Maggiore’s “second founder”, the monumental complex was redeveloped and expanded through work that lasted until 1649, culminating in the construction of the magnificent Central Courtyard, or the Cour d’Honneur, also named after Francesco Maria Richini, one of the architects involved in the redevelopment effort. </p><p>The 17th century project had to take into account what had already been constructed over the previous centuries, namely the quadrilateral built at the time of the Sforzas (the wing on the right) and the portico that connected it to the central courtyard Giovanni Antonio Amadeo (1447-1522) had almost finished by 1497. The 17th century work, which relied on the guidelines set out in the Filarete model for all four sides, completed the central courtyard starting from the entrance side. Work then proceeded along the front where the construction of the Annunciata church started in 1635 – which was therefore built not at the centre of the courtyard as Filarete had originally intended but absorbed in the southern side – and, finally, on the righthand side, where the portico was renovated, maintaining, however, the pre-existing decorative patterns. As established by the hospital administrators, the courtyard was built with the same materials that had been utilised in the 15th-century: columns in miarolo, or Baveno pink granite; the bases and capitals in ‘bastard’ or micaceous marble, otherwise known as Viggiù stone, while all the decorative parts in Angera stone. </p><p>The tondos with busts most likely from the late 15th-century depict biblical figures, apostles, sybils, saints and evangelists. The two reliefs with St. Ambrose and St. Joseph have been attributed to Giovanni Antonio Amadeo, the master of the workshop that made all the other tondos. Following the bombardments of August 1943, which also hit the Central Courtyard, the four sides were reconstructed utilising, for the most part, the original pieces.</p><p><hr></p><br>

Three out of the new four courtyards were made in a style different to that defined in Filarete’s original layout. The only exception being the one reserved to the Ca’ Granda rector and his family, which was architecturally similar to the 15th-century courtyards and known as the Quarto delle balie, the ‘wet-nurse quarter’ because it was located in a separate and protected part of the complex, thus becoming the designated area for wet-nurses where they could breast feed infants in full privacy. Following its significant enlargement, the hospital could now, in fact, take abandoned and undesired infants under its wing, weaning them and successively rearing them so they could be adopted. </p><p>During the Age of Enlightenment, numerous specialisation schools were founded in the Ospedale Maggiore, among which the pioneering school for surgery and anatomy and the school for obstetricians. The latter, founded in 1767 by Bernardino Moscati, was not only reserved for surgeons but also innovatively opened to “co-mothers” and “wet-nurses” (i.e. godmothers and midwifes) who were at least 18-years-old and “learned in reading and writing.”</p><p>The illuminated reformism of the Austrians in a Milan that was ever more receptive to science and technique soon turned the Ca’ Granda into a “teaching and specialisation hospital” under Maria Theresa, and into a “medical specialisation school” under her son Joseph II. The links between the hospital and Milanese society were further strengthened during the Risorgimento, especially during the uprising known as the Five Days of Milan (18-22 March 1848) when hospital doctors, healthcare staff , both men and women, took part in the events either aiding the wounded from both sides or taking up arms, combating on the barricades for the independence of Lombardy from Austrian rule, a struggle in which many sacrificed their lives.</p><p><hr></p><br>

Originally, at the centre of the courtyard was a cemetery built in 1473 by the master mason Ambrogio da Rosate at the back of the first chapel. The altar was initially placed where the crossbars met so that it could be viewed by all patients, so that they could assist the liturgical functions as was in the tradition of the ancient hospitals of the knights hospitaller of Jerusalem (present day Order of Malta). Successively, the chapel and burial yard were shifted, replaced by the apothecary’s workshop that was, in turn, transformed into the dispensary. The ice-house, located in the central part of the courtyard, is mentioned for the first time in November 1638 as the cella nivaria, the “snow cell.” The reservoir was filled in the winter months with snow, which, appropriately pressed and wetted, was allowed to freeze and used to preserve perishable food and, possibly, also for therapeutic purposes (to cure traumas, fevers, etc.). The exterior of the reservoir was surrounded by a semi-circular corridor that acted as a dispensary as well as a brick casing. The ice-house was managed an operator who was on the hospital payroll.</p><p>A surface well, originally serving the apothecary’s workshop and built by Boniforte Solari (1429 ca. – 1481 ca.), was located in the&nbsp; southwestern corner (1472). Overlooking the courtyard was possibly the old wash-house (1499), which could rely on an independent water conduit and on a mill, constructed between 1519 and 1523, whose milling stones were found during the challenging post-war restoration campaign. The Ice-House Courtyard was, in fact, the part of the complex that was most damaged during the 1943 bombings, and was fully restored in 1962.</p><p><hr></p><br>

While it was originally known as the “women’s courtyard” because it was reserved to female patients, by the 18th century it had come to be known as the “nizuola courtyard” probably because of the presence of a hazel tree, niscioeula being the Milanese word for “nut.” Successively until recent times it was renamed after the kitchens located along the eastern side. It was only starting from the second-half or the 18th-century that we find reference to a “woodshed,” located within the perimeter of the courtyard and surviving until 1943.</p><p>Prior to the restructuring financed by the Carcano bequeathal, wood was previously stored in the main courtyard behind the tiny church and attached burial ground. Archaeological digs carried out by the Università degli Studi in 1995 brought to light a large quantity of bones and animal horns, most likely the waste from the hospital’s slaughterhouse (built in 1494) or, more likely, from the kitchens or attached dispensary, which for a period were located in the cloister. The practice of slaughtering animals within the hospital probably started in the early part of the 16th century. It is likely this part of the edifice also hosted a panateram pristini, or bakery (built in 1478), a chicken coop and a pigsty (first mentioned in 1499) as well as a livestock shed (existing since 1500).</p><p>Within the central octagonal structure there once was a well having a diameter of 2 metres. It is not sure whether it was a surface well, from which water was drawn, or an underground sewerage well. A surface well for kitchen use, on the other hand, already existed in the north-western corner, made by Guglielmo del Conte in 1482. Surviving in the underground chambers on the side of the Naviglio – now via Francesco Sforza – are significant traces of the old stone washhouses, which are expected to be surveyed and restored by the University of Milan shortly. After washing, hospital bed sheeting and patients’ clothing were dried along the ditch or, if it rained, in the courtyard lodge on the first floor where they were warmed by the large chimneys of the kitchens below.</p>

Initially, the courtyard was reserved for the recovery of the aristocrats, who paid for their stay at the hospital, and was called the “gentlemen’s courtyard.” While successively renamed the “women’s separate courtyard,” as it was principally reserved to labouring women (the area around the San Nazaro church), it was also designated to the “scabbed” and the “delirious” of both sexes (the area by the portico), for it afforded a degree of isolation compared to the overcrowded wards of the Crociera. At the beginning of the 17th century, the area was turned into the “servants’ courtyard,” reserved to nursing staff and attendants. The courtyard had a coatroom (by the portico) and a wash-house (by the San Nazaro church). A surface well was located in the north-eastern corner, while a system of baths was constructed at the centre of the courtyard starting from the 18th century. The bathing complex had separate pools for men and women and, starting from 1802, also half-baths that allowed partial immersions. These served for hydrotherapy and were located in the infirmaries.</p>

Initially, the courtyard was designated to host the hospital’s administrative offices, among which the Chapter of the Deputies whose task was to handle the hospital’s administration and day-to-day affairs. It is likely, considering the prestige of the office, the venue was most likely elegantly decorated, as can still be observed by the traces of surviving framed graffiti depicting vases endowed with curves in the shape of snakes on whose rim birds are perched.</p><p>Work on the administrative area, which included the offices of the notary public and accountants besides the archives, was terminated with the construction of a hall, with fireplace (1468), that probably served as the capitulary. This was followed by the construction in 1502 of a refectory that was successively decorated by a mediocre reproduction of Leonardo’s Last Supper. It is likely the bread store was just next door. There also was, in the south-western corner, a well whose curb was probably made by the sculptor Giorgio Gariboldi (1464). In the secondhalf of the 17th century administration was moved elsewhere and the premises vacated were for the most part used by the pharmacy (laboratories, storerooms and dispensaries), including the small green space at the centre, which was transformed into a small botanical</p><p>garden.</p><p>The earliest mention of medicinal activities being carried out at the Ospedale Maggiore goes back to 1458 when Giovanni Vailati was appointed magister aromatarius. But it was only in 1470 that a formal agreement was signed authorising the opening of two chemist’s shops specialising in the&nbsp; administration and preparations of medicines exclusively for hospital patients. Therefore, the figure of the hospital apothecary had been formalised by the end of the 15th century as can be observed also from his distinctive garb. Apothecary staff, in fact, wore a black vest, which successively became grey or white, with the master apothecary wearing a more elaborate attire. The latter, in addition, had to live with his family in the apartments attached to the pharmacy as well as to ensure that the storeroom, dispensaries and laboratories were at all times replenished, to register all pharmaceutical therapies and to make sure that patients were given the prescribed medicines. The validity of the pharmaceutical recipes also had to be assessed and&nbsp; approved by two collegiate physicians. The apothecary had to enter in specific volumes the prescriptions given by each physician and assess its efficacy and economic viability: In fact, “the Duke’s medicaments,” as the medicines produced at Ca’ Granda came to be known, not only had to be effective in curative terms but also convenient economically.<br>Among the innovations introduced at the Ca’ Granda, one of the most significant certainly concerned the involvement of women in the professional care of the sick and that, too, in areas that went beyond mere nursing and<br>patient assistance. This trust in the professional skills of women explains, for example, the decision, on the part of the hospital chapter deputies, to appoint, at the death of the master apothecary Ardigò Cobeloni in December 1487, his widow Modesta to continue his work for three months – the time required to find a legally suitable replacement. The hospital chapter, in fact, promptly appointed Modesta’s second husband, Luchino del Bene, as the hospital’s new master apothecary, a man thus to be considered more as reliable business partner than an eager lover, impatient to tie the wedding knot. Another hospital pharmacy, with decorations by Stefano Cittadini, was opened in 1497. <br></p>

                                <p>Francesca Vaglienti</p><br><p>Filarete’s project for the Ospedale Maggiore was based on the Crociera, or Crossing, two long arms that intersected with each other at a right angle. While ensuring a large capacity in terms of patients, this module also allowed for the placing, at the centre, of an altar for the celebration of religious offices. The foundations, as well as the columns, were in sarizzo granite, and hosted building facilities, namely cellars, storerooms and workshops, which were therefore strictly separated from the infirmary section by a bar in Angera stone. Work, first started on the right-hand side Crociera in 1459, was terminated in 1465 under the supervision of Filarete himself. The required bricks and other terracotta building materials were produced on site thanks to the construction of three furnaces (1460-1464) located between the central courtyard and the Naviglio. Additional furnaces were also available outside Milan. By 1461 the structure appears to have been already fully endowed with a timber roof truss for whose entablature the hospital deputies sacrificed the entire Trivulzio Wood. Patients began to be admitted at least by 1474 when records show that 14 had died in the hospital in that year. The dead were all male, ranging from 16 to 80 years of age, and mostly came from Milan and surrounds, although some were probably foreigners judging by their surnames. The following year, the death toll rose to 18 and included two women, one 58 and the other 26.</p><p>The arms of the Crociera had acquaioli (stone washbasins having metal basins and buckets) constructed by Filarete in 1464, and by Guglielmo del Conte in 1486. Endowed, right from the outset, with a sewerage system, the hospital also had toilets, called necessaria (“necessaries”) or destri (“nimble”). Among the priorities duke Francesco Sforza had set out and recommended to Filarete was, in fact, the construction of an adequate number of toilets – one for every two beds – served vertically and horizontally by both running- and rainwater to ensure maximum and constant hygiene. Heating was provided by two huge chimneys, constructed by Andrea Castiglioni in 1465, to which an additional one was commissioned in 1477 by Boniforte Solari. Alongside each bed was a small wall opening that acted as a cabinet and as a small table, thanks to a wooden folding easel, that allowed patients to eat seated. In 1472, duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza ordered feather mattresses – a real luxury at that time – to be placed on the beds. Feather bedding would ultimately be replaced by woollen bedding only in 1802. The blankets were in leather and the sick, one for each bed, were given vests made of Vigevano drape, a mixed wool fabric widely used at that time, shoes (1477) and white caps (1486). At admission, the sick wereundressed, washed and combed with a fine brush to remove lice from hair and beards. The beds, warmed in winter, were made twice a day (mornings and afternoons), and twice a day the floors cleaned and the rooms aired. In warmer summers, halfway up the ceiling, wet sheets were hung.</p><p>Each arm had a name. The southern one – perpendicular to the Naviglio – and the first to be built, was dedicated to Bianca Maria Visconti and reserved to female patients. The entrance portal was decorated by a stone lunette depicting the Annunciation (1463-1465) by Cristoforo Luoni, a mediocre artist who was also the author of the funeral monument to Andrea Birago at the San Marco church. Atop the entrance from the west, leading to the crossbar known as Sala Madonna, and the opposite entrance from the Courtyard, leading to the Crociera arm known as Sala Pio II, there stood the lunettes made by Martino Benzoni, the first also dedicated to the Annunciation and the other depicting God the Father with Seraphs. Benzoni reproduced this same lunette on the entrance from the Portico of the Infirmary leading to the hall known as Sala Francesco Sforza. The western wings of the Crociera were mostly reserved to female patients and nurses, with the exception of the nuns who stayed above the Pharmacy Courtyard. Priests lodged, instead, in the quarters located above the Ice-House Courtyard.<br>In the 1490s, Ospedale Maggiore hosted 1,600 persons including patients and healthcare staff (physicians, surgeons and pharmacists); administrative personnel (accountants and scribes), and nursing personnel (barbers, wet nurses, obstetricians, nurses); and service personnel (servants, stretcher-bearers, barber-surgeons, bakers, tailors, cobblers, etc.). <br></p><p>In a bid to optimise space, new halls were created by adding mezzanines in the arms of the Crociera, which remained in use until the 19th century. In 1773, the hospital had 21 wards (“sale” i.e. plural of “sala”) with a total capacity of 1,022 patients, 67% of whom were admitted with unspecified febrile symptoms. Some patients had scabies, consumption or scurvy, while others bore wounds or lesions. <br></p>
