                                “I was born and lived almost forty years in South Bristol, Ontario County— one of the most secluded spots in Western New York, but from the earliest dawn of reason I pined for that freedom of thought and action that was then denied to all womankind . . . . But not until that meeting at Seneca Falls in 1848, of the pioneers in the cause, gave this feeling of unrest form and voice, did I take action.”<br />
—Emily Collins<br />
For Emily Collins, who went on to start a local equal rights organization, and for other women of 1840s America, the news of a women’s rights convention was a vivid reminder of their inferior status. By law or by custom an unmarried woman generally did not vote, speak in public, hold office, attend college, or earn a living other than as a teacher, seamstress, domestic, or mill worker. A married woman lived under these restrictions and more: she could not make contracts, sue in court, divorce her husband, gain custody of her children, or own property, even the clothes she wore. Though middle-class wives  reigned over the domestic sphere, legally their husbands controlled them. Individual women publicly expressed their desire for equality, but it was not until 1848 that a handful of reformers in Seneca Falls, New York, called “A Convention to discuss the social, civil, and religious condition and rights of Woman.”<br />
<br />
Why Seneca Falls? A significant reform community emerged in western New York in the 1830s and 1840s. Among these reformers were abolitionists who joined relatives and started businesses in Seneca Falls and Waterloo. Here and elsewhere, Quaker women like Lucretia Mott took an active role in the effort to end slavery. For Mott, her sister Martha Wright, Jane Hunt, Mary Ann M’Clintock, and 32- year-old Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the next logical step was to demand rights for women. In July 1848 they planned the convention and hammered out a formal list of grievances based on the Declaration of Independence, demanding equality in property rights, education, employment, religion, marriage and family, and suffrage. The demand for the vote was so radical that even Mott protested, but Stanton had her way. On July 19 the Declaration of Sentiments was presented to an audience of about 300. “We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal,” announced Stanton at the First Women’s Rights Convention.<br />
<br />
The women expected controversy. True ladies, a Philadelphia newspaper wrote after the convention, would be foolish to sacrifice their status as “Wives, Belles, Virgins and Mothers” for equal rights.<br />
Many signers of the declaration removed their names. But 12 days later a second convention was held in Rochester. By 1900 armies of women marched for suffrage. Today many of the convention’s most radical demands are taken for granted. The Declaration of Sentiments was the start; its words reach far beyond that warm July day in Seneca Falls.<br />

Text:
The Elizabeth Cady Stanton House was the family’s home for 15 years. Stanton’s activism was based in large part on her experiences as a Seneca Falls housewife. She was 31 years old when she moved here in 1847 with her husband Henry Stanton, a lawyer and abolitionist lecturer, and three boys. They had four more children.

Until she met Lucretia Mott and other reformers, Stanton found small-town life oppressive: “My duties were too numerous and varied and none sufficiently exhilarating or intellectual to bring into play my higher faculties. I suffered with mental hunger, which, like an empty stomach, is very depressing.”

Stanton defied many of the day’s housekeeping and child-rearing customs. For many years she dressed in an outfit popularized by Amelia Bloomer, loose pants and a knee-length skirt, which allowed freedom of movement.
 
She encouraged her seven children to join parlor discussions with visitors like the Motts and Frederick Douglass. She hosted a “conversation club” for young adults. Her benevolent work with the town’s poor made her all the more aware of women’s economic insecurity.

Guided tours of the Stanton house are available in summer and on a limited basis during the rest of the year.

Text:
On July 19 and 20, 1848, some 300 women and men gathered in the Wesleyan Chapel to hear the first formal demands for women’s rights. Curious local residents joined abolitionists, temperance workers, and reformers to fill the chapel.

On the first day they debated the wording of the Declaration of Sentiments. The Seneca County Courier reported that “an intelligent and respectful audience” attended the public session that evening to hear  the “eminently beautiful and instructive” discourse of Lucretia Mott. At the next day’s session the amended declaration was adopted; 100 women and men signed the document. Frederick Douglass reiterated his support at the final session.

                                Seneca Falls and Beyond &nbsp;“What are we next to do?” asked Elizabeth Cady Stanton after the 1848 convention. The women of Seneca Falls had challenged America to social revolution with a list of demands that touched every aspect of life. Fifty years after the convention, women saw progress in property rights, employment, education, divorce and custody laws, and social freedoms. By the early 1900s, a coalition of suffragists, temperance groups, progressive politicians, and social welfare organizations mustered a successful push for the vote.<br />
<br />
Although the ballot was never the primary agent of social reform, as many had hoped, the suffrage movement expanded women’s influence in the political arena. Again the question, What next?<br />
Immediately after 1920 many women worked for reform through groups like the League of Women Voters and national political parties. Some asserted their rights on a personal level by attending college, taking jobs, adopting new clothing fashions, and creating professional organizations. Then as now,   each woman sought her own definition of freedom.<br />
<br />
In 1848 the Seneca County Courier warned that the convention’s resolutions were “of the kind called radical . . . Some will regard them with respect—others with disapprobation and contempt.” The story of the women’s rights movement is the story of ideas once controversial, now commonplace. The chronology below outlines the major events that changed the status quo for women in America. Which of our present efforts will contribute toward a future of equality? What are we next to do?<br />

Text:
After the convention, Hunt and her husband continued with various reform efforts. The M’Clintocks moved to Philadelphia in 1856. Wright and two M’Clintock daughters became active suffragists. Stanton, Wright, and Mott, with Lucy Stone, Abby Kelly Foster, and Susan B. Anthony, led the woman’s rights movement through its formative years. Eventually the movement was called women’s rights.

</p><p>Picture is black and white. Elizabeth has a full, unlined face and is dressed in black with white frill around the neck and a dark colored bonnet with white frills. Protruding through the front of the bonnet is her lightly colored wavy hair. She is turned slightly to the left while looking back directly at the camera with a mischievous smirk on her face. Her daughter Harriot is in her arms, a chubby cheeked baby with a black outfit trimmed with white frill around the neck and middle. Harriot’s outfit is short-sleeved and her arms are crossed in front of her fists together. The baby is looking at the camera with her mouth slightly agape. Lucretia Mott is pictured half behind Elizabeth and the baby. She is wearing a light colored outfit with a high V-neck. Draped over her shoulders is a medium colored soft looking cloak. Lucretia is looking slightly to the left of the camera with a rather sad look on her face. She has some lines beginning to show on her face around the cheeks and mouth. She has a white, see-through bonnet on her head, bowed at the chin. Underneath her bonnet you can see her jet black hair. Lucretia’s sister, Martha Wright is next to and somewhat behind her. She has a jet-black outfit on, with a frilly white see-through bonnet bowed at the chin. Her hair is dark black and protruding out of the front of the bonnet. Her dark eyes are looking directly at the camera and she has a pale unlined face with a slit of a mouth showing little emotion. Mary Ann M’Clintock is behind and between her and Jane Hunt, looking directly at the camera with a determined expression. Mary Ann is wearing a layered outfit with a white shirt underneath with a high V-neck. She also has a darker colored cloak over her outfit. A white bonnet juts up on top of her head with dark hair protruding in the front. She has defined cheek bones and an otherwise unlined face. Next is Jane Hunt pictured in front of Mary Ann and part of Martha. She is looking off to the left of the camera with her hand resting at the side of her chin.

PORTRAIT BY GILBERT STUART NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART
</p><p>Abigail Adams: This is an oval portrait in color with a black background. Abigail is angled slightly to her left. She is wearing a goldish-brown outfit with a white covering coming down in an arc covering from her shoulders to midway down her chest. Over this she is wearing a see-through lace shoulder covering. She has a large white frilly neck covering, coming down perhaps an inch and a half. On her head she has a fancy white bonnet with a thick white ribbon around it. She has a light skin tone with rouge on her cheeks. Abigail has high eyebrows and wide-open challenging dark eyes, and a slit of a mouth over a protruding nose. Shadows cover her forehead from the overhanging bonnet.</p></div>

Lucy Stone’s picture has a gray circular haze around it, fuzzy at the edges. She is wearing a dark outfit showing lots of vertical lines or plaits. A white shirt collar is protruding from the top. Although her body is facing to her left her head is looking off to her right. She has a determined challenging gaze and a lineless full face. Her mouth is compressed into a line and her dark eyes are staring fixedly up and to her right. Frederick’s image is of him in a dark suit over a darker vest, with a black ascot or tie obscuring much of the white collared shirt underneath. He has full hair parted on his left. His eyes are looking slightly off to his left and his mouth is compressed with a proud, almost angry stare.</p></div>

Stanton and Anthony work successfully to amend the 1848 Married Women’s Property Act of New York. Revised law allows wives to hold property, keep earnings and inheritances, make contracts, sue in court, and share child custody.<br />
<br />
1861–65<br />
Civil War. Northern and Southern women take over jobs on farms and in factories, businesses, and government offices. Thousands of women work as nurses, opening profession to females.<br />
<br />
1862 <br />
Morrill Act grants federal land to support coeducational colleges and universities in the West. Homestead Act grants free land to any “head of household,” including women. New York’s 1860 property law is repealed.<br />
<br />
1863 <br />
After Emancipation Proclamation frees many slaves in Confederacy, Stanton and Anthony’s National Women’s Loyal League urges Congress to outlaw slavery completely. Mott and contemporaries turn over leadership to the rising generation. Younger women’s leaders anticipate that postwar expansion of civil rights will include female suffrage. Thirteenth Amendment outlaws slavery in 1865.<br />
<br />
1867 <br />
First statewide women’s suffrage campaigns in Kansas and New York are defeated.<br />
<br />
1869 <br />
Suffragists split over strategy after 14th Amendment specifies voting rights for “male citizens.” Stanton and Anthony form National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), which pushes for a women’s suffrage amendment. Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe, and others organize American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) to support voting rights first for black males, then women. Wyoming becomes first US territory to enact women’s suffrage.<br />

Anthony and colleagues test 14th and 15th amendments by casting votes in New York. Suffragists are arrested and fined. An 1875 US Supreme Court ruling upholds states’ right to deny women the vote. In 1876 Anthony and others crash US Centennial celebration in Philadelphia’s Independence Hall, demanding women’s vote.

</p><p>Susan B. Anthony over the revolution: Susan B. Anthony’s black and white photograph is superimposed over the bottom right side of the image of a newspaper called ‘The Revolution’. The top of the paper reveals their slogan ‘Principle not policy, Justice, Not Favors’. The newspaper is dated Wednesday, January 8th, 1868 and it is published in New York. Susan’s image has her body facing off to her right and her head facing off to her left. She is wearing a soft black outfit with black cloth covered buttons down the front. Over this is a large white frilly lace ‘tie’, it goes around the top of her outfit around the neck, then crosses at the front and fans out in both directions down to the middle of her chest. At the cross of the lace there is a white brooch holding it together. She has dark hair put up on the back of her head and small wire rimmed glasses. Her face is clear and white and she has a wide thin mouth. Her expression is that of a schoolmarm watching over her students.</p></div>

Backed by the NWSA, a women’s suffrage amendment is first introduced in Congress but not voted on for 10 more years. As Reconstruction era draws to a close, Southern blacks see erosion of their new civil rights.<br />
<br />
1879 <br />
Frances Willard becomes president of Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU), established in 1874 to fight alcohol-related social ills. Willard strongly advocates women’s suffrage as a means to impose a moral influence on society. WCTU becomes nation’s largest women’s organization by the 1880s.<br />
<br />
1881 <br />
Knights of Labor organizes housewives, domestics, factory workers, railroad workers; 65,000 women join. Knights disband by 1886 after losing national strike. Women’s organized labor recovers by the early 1900s to become an active force in suffragism.<br />
<br />
1887 <br />
WCTU and suffragists present US Senate with petition supporting suffrage amendment. Amendment is defeated.<br />
<br />
1889 <br />
Jane Addams and Ellen Starr establish Hull House in Chicago, nation’s first settlement house. In the following decades an army of educated female reformers—young single women, wives, mothers, and grandmothers—investigates labor conditions, starts settlement houses, promotes education and public health, agitates for liberalized birth control laws, and marches for suffrage. Increasingly, activists see vote as a mechanism to improve society.<br />
<br />
1890 <br />
Wyoming is admitted as first women’s suffrage state. Colorado and Idaho follow; campaigns in these states are led by Carrie Chapman Catt. Utah enacts women’s suffrage in 1896 to ensure Mormon control. NWSA and AWSA merge into the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Stanton is president, succeeded by Anthony in 1892. Frances Willard sits on executive board. NAWSA strategy shifts from constitutional amendment to state referenda.<br />
<br />
1902 <br />
Elizabeth Cady Stanton dies at age 86. Four years later Susan B. Anthony dies at 85. New generation of suffragists are solidly in power, arguing for vote on basis of female moral superiority rather than equality. NAWSA is led by Anna Howard Shaw and Carrie Chapman Catt.<br />

Temperance societies, first popular in the 1830s, are among the earliest American women’s groups. The crusade makes women all the more aware of their legal defenselessness against a drunken husband and the need for property and divorce rights. After the Civil War the movement reemerges, its leaders promoting female suffrage as a means of social reform.

To the right side of the image is a saloon with a ‘Jerry Class Saloon’ sign over the doorway. In the doorway facing to the side is the barkeep with his apron on looking sullen in a loose fitting suit. At his feet facing the other way is an obviously inebriated man sitting on the ground and leaning against the doorway. He is wearing a rumpled suit and looks unkempt and unshaven. To both sides of this doorway are windows with two men looking out of each one. To the left side the two men in light colored clothing and hats are looking angrily and confrontationally at the women outside. To the right side two men hang out of the window wearing dark colored clothing and hats. They are obviously inebriated and leaning on the windowsill looking sullen and hostile. Outside the shop 4 women are ringing the doorway. Three of them are on their knees praying in puffy black dresses. They have fancy hairstyles with fancy hats interwoven. The final woman is standing and appears to be reading aloud from a small book though her eyes are closed. There are signs on the wall that say ‘GIN’, ‘Brandy Smash’, ‘Hot Drinks’, ‘Pepper Pot’, and ‘Old Rye’.</p></div>

</p><br><p>Statues: There are two images; the one in the background is the ‘Meeting Statues’ and superimposed on that is Elizabeth Cady-Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. The statues image is a portrayal of Amelia Bloomer introducing Susan B. Anthony to Elizabeth Cady Stanton. It is metal, bluish-black in color. Amelia is wearing a wide hat that sticks out all around her head perhaps 3 inches. Amelia is looking at Susan, her hands outstretched between them, bringing them together. Susan is wearing a bonnet and is reaching out her hand to shake Elizabeth’s. Elizabeth is holding a book in one hand while reaching out the other and she has a shawl draped over her shoulders. The other image is superimposed over the lower half of the statue photo and it is in black and white. Elizabeth is sitting down while Susan stands next to her. They are both holding one corner of something they are reading together. Elizabeth is wearing all white with white bouncy curls on her head. Susan is standing and wearing a black dress with black ribbons around the wrists of the dress and a white shirt collar protruding at the top. She has her hair tied back in a bun at the back of her head. The women are both older but their faces reveal that they are still working hard at their cause.</p></div>

Back to the left is a white button with red letters that says ‘Women’s Liberation’ wrapped around the bottom and a symbol that looks like the statue of liberty with a large fist being held up. Finally back to the right is a white button with blue letters that says ‘Every Mother Is A Working Mother’.
