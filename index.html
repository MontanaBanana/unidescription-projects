The forest shrouding the land, the rivers running through it, and the sea around it provided everything needed to sustain a vigorous human community. Tlingits had thrived on the island they called Shee for countless generations before ambitious traders came from the west in search of new goods. Here Tlingits and Russians met, fought, and then uneasily coexisted for a time. When the Russians departed after six decades, both groups had been changed by the encounter. The Tlingits preserved their traditions as the Americans who replaced the Russians wrought their own changes. In the 1960s, after decades of acculturation and population decline, Tlingits began to reassert their culture. If you pay close attention to the landscape, artifacts, and artisans of Sitka National Historical Park, you will hear the story of the cultures who lived, and still live, on this island.</p><p><strong>Photo collage description:</strong>&nbsp;Along with the text, the upper half of side one of the brochure is filled with color photographs of the landscape, buildings, and artifacts.

On the left is a larger tree trunk, obscured by the branch and needles of a tree not fully seen.&nbsp;</p><p>On the right is a second, cut-out picture of the top portion of a totem pole, painted in the traditional colors of red, light greenish-blue and black. The top figure is a raven head with large, over dramatized eyes. Its dark beak with red lips juts out from the vertical pole. The raven figure sits atop a cylinder-shaped hat on the figure of a man. The hat has three teal rings painted on it and the man has dark thick eyebrows and lips. The rest of the totem pole cannot be seen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Photos credits: </strong>Totem Pole – Patrick J.

The front of the building is lined downstairs with windows framed by white, open shutters. The windows are evenly spaced along the building, with a slight space between them. The windows are divided into six panes with white wood. The upstairs windows, placed directly above the downstairs windows, have a similar appearance but do not have shutters and have eight panes. Above this building front, is a red, slanted roof. Off to the right, attached to the building is a two-story gallery. The gallery has the same upstairs window design as the rest of the building, but the windows touch each other. Downstairs, it does not have windows, but two doors, which open to the front, onto a wooden, red, open porch. A blue sky peeks out from above the house.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Photo credit:&nbsp;</strong>©Brian Hetherington<br></p>                                                <div>

We are facing the far wall in the white painted room. In the middle of the wall, are open double doors. The doors each have three, equally spaced, gold-framed icons displayed upon them. These and the other icons within the photo are too small to tell their contents, but each is generally a color painting framed in gold. They feature one or several religious figures in the Byzantine style. The paintings are embellished with gold and in some cases silver leaf paint. Often, a gold-painted halo surrounds the figure’s head. Some also incorporate highly embellished metals giving them dimension.</p><p>On the wall to the left and right of the open doors, hang rectangular icons. Above each, hangs a circular icon. The doors open into the nave or center part of the chapel and peek in on a view of a rectangular, box-shaped alter. The altar is draped with a light blue tapestry with gold accents and has a gold candelabra on top of it. An icon in a gold frame hangs above the altar.&nbsp;</p><p>In front of the far wall is the space called the iconostasis. Hanging in this space, in front of the icons that flank the open doubled doors, are two gold colored candelabras with white candles. In front of the iconostasis is the sanctuary of the chapel, which takes up a majority of the room. It has three altars which are equally spaced within the room and face the far wall. Each of these alters have a light blue tapestry draped over them, with a square icon displayed on top. The center altar is flanked by two tall candelabras with white candles.&nbsp;</p>&nbsp;<strong>Photo credit:&nbsp;</strong>Fred Hirschmann                                                <div>

Food resources were so abundant that the Tlingit essentially harvested whatever they needed. A maritime people, they drew much of their food from the sea and the rivers flowing into it. Salmon, the nutritious staple of their diet, was available in staggering quantities during the spawning runs. The Tlingit also fished on the open sea, wrestling 5-foot-long halibut into their canoes; hunted sea mammals; and gathered shellfish and edible seaweed. They hunted land animals and supplemented their diet with berries, grasses, and roots.&nbsp;</p><p>Cedar and other conifers in the great rain forest climbing the mountains behind Sitka provided the durable, straight-grained wood from which the Tlingit shaped much of their material world. They cut great beams and split planks to build their multi-family dwellings. Their basic structures were rectangular, pitched-roof buildings with round or oval entrances. From trunks they carved canoes up to 60 feet long, built in various types and sizes for fishing, sea travel, river travel, or war. They fashioned everyday implements from alder, like spoons and bowls, and crafted bentwood boxes to hold their large stocks of food and fish oil. Theirs was a bountiful life.&nbsp;</p>                                    <div>

The sea otter pelts they took home to show the Czar drew them back to stay, and the area was soon overrun with Russian promyshlenniki—free-ranging hunters and fur traders. The Russians (called Anooshi by the Tlingits) were likely the first Old World traders to encounter Alaska Natives. Through barter and coercion the promyshlenniki used the skills of the native Aleutians—the Aleuts—to gather the profitable pelts. By 1784 a Russian trading company employing promyshlenniki had established a station on Kodiak Island, and forced Aleuts to hunt sea otter and other sea mammals. Russia remained the dominant power in the North Pacific for 125 years.</p><p>Wanting to stabilize Russia’s foothold in the New World, Czar Paul I in 1799 granted a monopoly to the Russian-American Company, giving the company’s manager Alexander Baranov the powers of a colonial governor. Baranov had already been pushing operations east and south from Kodiak Island to extend Russia’s territorial claims and thwart growing competition in the fur trade from England and the United States. He also wanted to stop the British and American practice of trading guns to the Tlingits, a powerful group in Southeast Alaska. To those ends he planned to establish a fortified station on Baranof Island, the one called Shee by its native inhabitants.</p><p><strong>Photo descriptions: </strong>On the bottom middle right half of side one of this brochure are a series of black and white photographs next to a photo of the Tlingit canoe and berry basket.

In their midst stands a middle-aged white woman, presumably their teacher also dressed in white.</p><p><strong>Photo credit:</strong> NPS Merrill Collection</p><br>                                                <div>

It is approximately 1.5 times his size. The paddle section of the baton is of a man-sized carved Salmon. The men on the left and right wear ermine-skin shirts and hold a raven and an octopus button, which are long boards they use while dancing.

Under the direction of company manager Alexander Baranov, a group of Russians, Alutiiq, and other Native Alaskans constructed the first non-Native settlement near Starrigavan Bay in 1799. Powerful leaders of the Kiks.di clan quickly grew to resent the Russian intrusion. In 1802, they attacked the Starrigavan settlement, Redoubt St. Michael, and killed most of its Russian, Aleut, and Alutiiq inhabitants.&nbsp;</p><p>After the Tlingit drove the Russians from Sitka in 1802, Tlingit Shaman Stoonookw predicted the Russians would return. He urged the clans to build a new fortification strong enough to withstand cannon fire. The Kiks.ádi chose an area near present-day Indian River for their new fort (Shis'gi Noow) because it was close to food and fresh water, but out of range of the ship artillery. When the Russian ships appeared at the mouth of Indian River (Kaasda Heen) on September 28, 1804, Kiks.ádi preparations were tested by a siege and multi-day bombardment.&nbsp;</p><p>Two fateful events worked against the Kiks.adi- the unexpected arrival of the Russian frigate <em>Neva </em>and the loss of the canoe carrying their reserve ammunition and most seasoned warriors right before the battle. Russian forces boldly waded ashore in a frontal attack on Shis'gi Noow on October 1, 1804. They were driven back from the fort to the beach when Tlingit defenses held. Hidden behind floating logs, Kiks.adi warriors counter-attacked. They were led by K'alyaan (Katlian) wielding the blacksmith's hammer he had won in 1802. Russian forces retreated to their ships and laid siege. After six days the Kiks.ádi withdrew from the fort and marched north to Peril Strait. There they set up a trade blockade, while continuing to hunt, fish and gather wild food in and near Sitka Sound. Today, Sitka National Historical Park preserves and interprets the site of this battle.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Text and image descriptions:</strong> This text and a painting and bronze plaque to its left are located on most of the top left side of side two of this brochure.

In the foreground, the Tlingit warriors are equipped with long guns and spears. Some wear protective wooden war helmets and a thick wooden breast shield. The strong wall of logs in the right corner is part of the fort the Tlingit built for this battle.</p><p>The battle’s leader Katlian wears a raven war helmet and a gray fur around his naked upper torso. His weapon is a blacksmith hammer, which he holds upright in a striking position along with his other arm, which is held upright with a clenched fist. He storms into the scene, leading a group of warriors to the battleground. They are all lunging forward. One Tlingit is already dead on the ground. Though the cause of death cannot be seen, the arrows around him suggest he was killed by one of them.</p><p>Further in the background, a rain of arrows come from the Aleut and Alutiiq natives who accompany the Russians. Behind them is the Sitka Sound with three Russian vessels and a flood of small canoes, holding one person each. In the distance behind the water is the mountain range.</p><p><strong>Painting credit: </strong>©Louis S. Glanzman</p>                                                <div>

On the rocky promontory now called Castle Hill he located his home and harbor fortifications. The Russians never became self-sufficient depending on fresh food from the Tlingit who had stayed in the area. The company remained wary of them, maintaining a stockade between the communities. The Russian Orthodox mission, though, established a sympathetic relationship with the Tlingit.</p>
<p>By the mid-1800s the Russian government had grown disenchanted with its stake in America. When the United States offered to buy Alaska in 1867, Russia accepted and Sitka became a US territorial capital. In 1890 the US government created a federal reserve, Indian River Park, at the mouth of the river. The park was designated Sitka National Monument in 1910, then became part of the National Park System when that system was established in 1916. In 1972, with the addition of the Russian Bishop’s House, it was re-designated Sitka National Historical Park.</p><p><strong>Text and image descriptions:</strong>&nbsp;This text is on the right top side of side two of the brochure.

The Tlingit were divided into moieties, the Eagle and Raven. Clans, the basic social and economic units, controlled resources and trade routes. So abundant was food that large surpluses were created, allowing the Tlingit time to bring decorative design to every area of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Photo descriptions:</strong> To the right of this text on side two of the brochure are three images. From left to right they are:</p><ol><li>A color photo of the war helmet worn by the battle leader Katlian in 1804. It is carved in the form of a raven head which includes its eyes and beak. Due to its age, the material looks torn and fragile. It seems as if the helmet was once fully covered with fur. In this image, most of the fur is missing and only tufts in sections of the helmet are visible. A big crack is visible in the bottom right portion of the helmet that leads up to the beak. <strong>Photo credit: </strong>Peter Metcalfe</li><li>&nbsp;Kiks.ádi battle leader Katlian used a blacksmith’s hammer as his weapon for the 1804 battle against the Russians. In this cutout photograph of the hammer, the metal head looks old and used, with outworn striking surfaces and heavily scratched sides. The handle has been exchanged and looks relatively new and smooth. <strong>Photo credit</strong>: K'alyaan's Hammer- Kiks.ádi Clan&nbsp;</li><li>In this black and white photo, a large group of Tlingit stand in front of their wooden-sided clan house. They hold different decorative objects. Some are dressed in traditional cloth with flamboyant designs, others are dressed in simple American-looking suits, ties, and hats. Among the presented objects are rattles, drums, long guns and a life-size puppet that sits in front of the group. Many of the men wear big nose rings through the nasal septum and have painted faces. <strong>Photo credit:</strong> Tlingit Group- Alaska State Library</li></ol>                                                <div>

This temperate rain forest ecosystem is dominated by towering Sitka spruce and Western hemlock. Brown bears, river otters, mink, and black-tailed deer frequent the area. The park's intertidal zone teems with marine invertebrates like sea stars, limpets, and barnacles. The area hosts 150 bird species, and pink salmon runs sometimes pack the Indian River with over tens of thousands of fish.&nbsp;</p><p>Salmon are the ultimate recyclers: Aquatic insects, a critical food source for juvenile salmon, feed on organic nutrients in the Indian River. Salmon eventually head to sea to feed on rich ocean resources. Mature salmon return to the river to spawn and die. Their carcasses provide food for bears, ravens, and eagles and add nutrients to the stream ecosystem, jump-starting a new generation of salmon.&nbsp;</p>                                    <div>

The poles have been park of the Sitka story since 1901, when a collection of poles donated by villages from southern Southeast Alaska were shown at national expositions in 1904 and 1905, then shipped to Sitka and erected in Indian River Park. Traditionally the poles were allowed to deteriorate naturally, and many of those you see today are replicas.&nbsp;</p><p>Woodcarving is a fundamental art form of Northwest American Indian cultures, and the totem pole is among their highest achievements. These are public records, displays of identity and clan pride serving several functions: Crest poles record the ancestry of a family; legend poles recount a clan's story; and memorial poles commemorate an individual clan member.&nbsp;</p><p>The art of carving totem poles lives in Sitka: A few of the park's poles have been raised in 1976. Tribal organizations continue to carve poles that address themes like wellness and healing.&nbsp;</p>                                    <div>

                                                                                                                                            <p><strong>Map description:</strong>&nbsp;In the lower middle half of side two of the brochure is an illustrated map. The map identifies the layout of downtown Sitka and the grounds of Sitka National Historical Park. The park is approximately 113 acres and is a half of a mile from downtown Sitka. The left of the map is also the west side of Sitka’s downtown area and one of two cruise ship tender docks. Areas of interest include:</p><p></p><ul><li>Baranof Castle Hill State Historic Site&nbsp;<br></li><li>Totem Square&nbsp;<br></li><li>Site of Russian stockade and blockhouses&nbsp;<br></li><li>Alaska Native Brotherhood Hall&nbsp;<br></li><li>Site of Tlingit village and reconstructed blockhouse&nbsp;<br></li><li>Russian Cemetery &nbsp;<br></li><li>Saint Michael’s Cathedral&nbsp;<br></li></ul><p></p><p>Going east along the Sitka Sound shoreline is the second cruise ship tender dock located in Crescent Harbor. The Harrington Centennial Hall Sitka Historical Museum and the Russian Bishop’s House are located close by.&nbsp;</p><p>Continuing east en route to the park via Lincoln Street for approximately one-fourth of a mile are the park grounds. The Sheldon Jackson Museum is close by and the Park Visitor Center is the first place you will arrive at in the park. A restroom is available there.&nbsp;</p><p>The park has two main masses of land divided by the Indian River into a lower section, which largely borders the Sitka Sound on the park’s west and south side and the Indian River on this lower section’s upper side. The upper section of the park is bordered by the Indian River on its lower side and land on its upper side, which is also the north and east border of the park.</p><p>The Totem Trail is east of the Visitor Center and travels in a long oval around the lower section of the park. Halfway along the trail at the tip of the landmass and the Sitka Sound is where the 1804 Battle of Sitka occurred. Continuing to travel towards the Indian River on this trail is the Kiks-ádi Fort site.</p><p>Another trail from behind the Visitor Center traveling due east crosses the Indian River to the upper section of the park. A restroom is available there. Like the lower section of the park, there is also a long oval trail that leads down to the edge of the land that meets the water where the Russian Memorial is located.</p>                                                <div>
