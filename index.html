In the background, light reflects off the waters of the Columbia River. On the opposite side of the river is the forested southern bank, where present-day Oregon state is located. One tall ship with white sails floats eastward on the river; another ship appears to be docked on the shore.</p><p>On the north bank of the river is Fort Vancouver. A rectangular palisade wall encloses a number of wooden buildings, which are mostly obscured. The buildings have wood shingled roofs; four are painted white. In the northwestern corner of the fort is a tall tower called a bastion. In the southeastern corner, wooden buildings are positioned outside the fort palisade.</p><p>To the west of the fort lies the employee Village and Waterfront Complex, where many Hudson's Bay Company employees lived and worked. A series of small wooden houses can be seen in the distance, and several structures can be seen along the waterfront.</p><p>North of the fort palisade, a dirt road leads up from the fort gates to another main thoroughfare - a long dirt road that runs east-west, from one end of the painting to the other, almost bisecting the image. Two small figures and a person on a horse travel along this road.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.42857;">On the eastern side of the north-south road that leads to the fort's gates is another grassy field and two low buildings with sloping roofs. On the western side of the north-south road is an orchard with many roughly-sketched trees. Fences line both roads.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">On the north side of the east-west road is a grassy field in which two shepherds stand, along with three white sheep. One farmer is holding a long shepherd's crook.&nbsp;</span>At the western end of this field are two large, two-story wooden buildings.</p><p>In the foreground, a small group of people are on a dirt path. An ongahjay, or fur trade employee, wearing a blue shirt and red cap and belt sits atop a cart pulled by a horse. Close to him are two American Indians - one rides a brown horse, the other, wearing tan leather clothing and carrying a large load on his backs, walks.&nbsp;</p><p>On the right and left sides of the painting in the foreground are also are evergreen trees, grass, and bursts of foliage.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>BEINECKE RARE BOOK AND MANUSCRIPT LIBRARY, YALE UNIVERSITY</p><br>

By 1818 the two nations had agreed to share access to the Oregon Country, as they had come to call the region, until they could decide upon a boundary. Seven years later, in a bold move designed to anchor Britain’s claim to all of Oregon, the Hudson’s Bay Company—the giant fur trading organization—moved its Columbia Department headquarters from Fort George at the mouth of the Columbia to the newly established Fort Vancouver, 100 miles upstream. For the next two decades Fort Vancouver was directed by strong-willed, capable men who made it into the fur trade capital of the Pacific coast.</p><p>Primarily responsible for the post’s success was Dr. John McLoughlin, an energetic man and a genius at organization who served as chief factor during most of those years. In the 1830s and 1840s American settlers were attracted to the rich farm lands of Oregon’s Willamette Valley. McLoughlin made supplies and credit available to the needy settlers. This influx of Americans resulted in a division of the Oregon Country in 1846 along the 49th parallel, a decision that left—contrary to British hopes—Fort &nbsp;Vancouver on American soil. For a few years the Hudson’s Bay Company continued to trade with the settlers and Indians, but trade diminished and the company moved out in 1860. By 1866 fires and decay had destroyed all the structures.</p>

He joined the North West Company&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">as a physician at its post at Fort William (now Thunder Bay, Ontario). When&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">the North West and Hudson’s Bay companies merged, McLoughlin was&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">named head of the Columbia Department. His job was to keep peace with&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">the Indians, squeeze Americans out of the market, and firmly establish the&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">British claim to all of Oregon. As a businessman, McLoughlin succeeded.&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">But he was hospitable and generous to the growing number of American&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">settlers who came to Oregon, selling them supplies and extending them&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">credit. His superiors became more and more critical. When the new&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">boundary was agreed upon in 1846, McLoughlin retired, moved to Oregon&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">City, Ore., and became an American citizen. To Oregonians he has come to&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">be called the “Father of Oregon.”</span></p>

                                <p><strong>Text:&nbsp;</strong>Long before the American West was settled, it had been crisscrossed by lone scouts and hunters and trappers searching for new untouched &nbsp;trapping grounds. At the center of this fur trading enterprise stood the Hudson’s Bay Company and its main post, Fort Vancouver. As the vagaries of fashion carried the beaver hat to the height of popularity, the demand for that animal’s fur increased enormously. From Fort Vancouver the Hudson’s Bay Company sent out brigades of trappers that included from 50 to 200 men, women, and children. Trapping was hard and often dangerous work, particularly because most of it was done in the winter, when the pelts are the thickest.</p><p>The earliest trappers had adopted the Indians’ method of breaking into a beaver lodge and taking the animals, but soon the steel trap came into use.</p>

The trap, designed to catch the beaver by the leg, was set in shallow water. It was attached by a chain to a sharpened stake implanted in deeper water. The traps were baited with castoreum, a scent obtained from glands in the hind legs of the beaver. All this activity was going on while the trapper stood in the water, often ice-cold, so that he did not leave his scent on the bank.</p><p><strong>Line drawing description:</strong>&nbsp;Two 19th century fur trappers stand in water to set a beaver trap.

Back at camp, he or his Indian wife scraped the flesh from the skins and stretched them to dry.</p><p>After almost a year in the wilderness, the trapping brigades, with their furs in tow, got ready to head back to Fort Vancouver. Joining up with one another, the brigades made their way to the Columbia and Fort Vancouver where the people awaited their arrival. It was a festive time of year, and the trappers themselves made a show of their arrival, donning their best and most colorful clothes, swaggering out of their boats, and jauntily unloading their furs. The winters in the wilderness had convinced them that they were superior to the fort’s regular work force.</p><p>Now the company clerks took over, appraising the furs, paying the trappers, and preparing the furs for shipment to London. Turning the beaver pelts into the fashionable hats involved a number of steps. The hats were not made from the whole pelt as is sometimes assumed. First, the coarse guard hairs were pulled off. Then, the soft and desirable underfur was shaved off and set aside.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">From experience the hatters knew how much fur was needed to make one hat. They weighed out the proper amount of fur and piled it in a small mound.</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="line-height: 1.42857; white-space: pre;">	</span></p><p><strong>Line drawing description:&nbsp;</strong>A round beaver skin is tied to a wood hoop to help it stretch and dry.

                                <p><strong>Painting description: </strong>This color&nbsp;painting shows Fort Vancouver as it would have appeared in the 1840s. In the background is the south bank of the Columbia River, and the river itself. A tall, white-sailed ship floats eastward on the river. Along the north bank of the river are several wooden buildings, representing the fort's Waterfront Complex. Near this complex of industrial and agricultural buildings are several small cabins, representing the fort's employee village. Patches of evergreen trees are also present.</p><p>In the foreground is Fort Vancouver. It is surrounded by a tall wooden palisade made of timbers. 21 buildings can be seen inside the fort. They are all wooden, though four are painted white. Inside the fort palisade is also a flagpole and a bell tower, as well as several people. At the northwest corner of the fort, a tower - called a bastion - is present. Along the north wall of the fort, the fort gate is open, and several people and horses are gathered there. Outbuildings are present at the fort palisade's southeast corner. Outside the palisade wall on the fort's west side is a large agricultural field.</p><p>A fenced road extends northward from the fort gate and bisects with an east-west road. On the northern side of the fort is a large orchard and an agricultural field being plowed by a farmer and horse. On the northern side of the intersection where the north-south and east-west roads meet are two large two-story buildings and two smaller sheds. Another smaller wood building with a fenced area is located in the lower right of the image.</p><p>Fifteen areas, which are mostly buildings, are numbered on the painting and described in more detail with associated text.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>NPS/Richard Schlect</p><p><strong>Text:&nbsp;</strong>Since 1966 Fort Vancouver’s palisade and several buildings have been reconstructed on their original locations.

Chief Factor’s Residence: Early visitors to Fort Vancouver called the home of the post’s most senior officer “very handsome” and “commodious and elegant.” Built to replace an earlier structure, the Big House was impressive—with white clapboard siding and a large front veranda. Grapevines climbed on iron trellises, and two spiked cannon stood in front. Clerks and officers ate meals in a large mess hall, where parties and dances were also held.</p><br>

                                <p><strong>Text:&nbsp;</strong>Fort Vancouver was headquarters for the Hudson’s Bay Company’s Columbia Department, embracing present-day British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. The trading post also represented Britain’s business and governmental interests in competition with the United States.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The fort’s warehouses stocked supplies for the fur brigades, the Indian and settler trade, and for the 20 to 30 other Company posts in the Department. Most Indians were shrewd traders, so trade goods were carefully chosen. Almost all trade items were imported from or through Britain, so there was a two-year lapse between ordering and receiving.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The fort’s shops bustled with activity, manufacturing as many items as possible. The fort echoed to the sounds of carpenters hammering and sawing, of blacksmiths making new tools and repairing old ones, and of coopers making barrels. Carts rumbled to and fro piled high with supplies and with firewood for the bakehouse’s large brick ovens. Indians arrived to trade, passing by farmers and herders tending crops and livestock.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Company clerks bent over account books figuring out how much who owed whom. Frequent visitors were welcomed and eagerly quizzed for news and gossip of the outside. The arrival of a supply ship or a Royal Navy vessel was cause for celebration.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Although everyone worked hard and long hours—Sunday was the only day of rest in the early years—free time was enjoyed to the fullest. Hunting, riding, picnicking, footracing, and other competitive feats of strength were favored pastimes. Once a group of naval officers produced a play, the first known theatrical performance in the Pacific Northwest.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">Clerks and officers, who came from the British Isles and Canada, formed &nbsp;what was known as the “gentlemen” class. The working lower class, or engagés, made up most of the employees. Gentlemen and their families &nbsp;lived a comfortable life within the fort’s palisade, while laborers lived in crude dwellings in the village.</span></p><p><span style="line-height: 1.42857;">The workers at the fort represented many nationalities. George Simpson wrote a description of a trip down the Columbia River that indicated the diversity of Fort Vancouver. “Our crew of ten men contained Iroquois who spoke their own tongue; a Cree halfbreed of French origin, who appeared to have borrowed his dialect from both his parents; a North Briton who understood only the Gaellic of his native hills; Canadians who, of course, knew French, and Sandwich (Hawaiian) Islanders, who jabbered a medley of chinook and their own vernacular jargon. Add to all this that the passengers were natives of England, Scotland, Russia, Canada, and the Hudson Bay Territories.”</span></p>

The map is orientated with North at the top. The reserve is a rectangular shaped area approximately 366 square miles nestled between Highway 5 and Hghway 14, the Columbia River, and the City of Vancouver. The Visitor Center is located less than a mile to the northeast of the reconstructed fort. State Route 14 runs between the main areas of the park and its Columbia River Waterfront property. Interstate 5 runs along the parks western boundary. On the west side of Interstate 5 is the downtown section of the City of Vancouver. The park can be entered from the north via Fort Vancouver Way, from the east or west via East Evergreen Boulevard, or from the east via East Fifth Street. The reconstructed fort is located just south of East Fifth Street.</p>
