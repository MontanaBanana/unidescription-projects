</strong></p><p>The most isolated major island group on Earth, the Hawaiian archipelago is 2,400 miles from the nearest continent. The chain reaches from the Big Island of Hawai‘i (at about the same latitude as Mexico City) to Kure Atoll 1,500 miles to the northwest, and it is still growing. For at least 81 million years, new islands have been forming as the Pacific Plate moves northwestward over a stationary plume of magma rising from a “hot spot” within the Earth´s mantle. The fluid rock makes its way up through the ocean floor, and countless eruptions over hundreds of thousands of years eventually create a volcanic island. But the plate´s unceasing movement slowly separates the volcano from its source, terminating its growth even as a new volcano rises from the ocean floor over the hot spot. The volcano that formed East Maui, part of which lies within the boundaries of the national park, last erupted about two centuries ago.</p></p>

Average temperatures range from 75°F at sea level to 40°F at the summit of the highest volcanoes.

The roughly 10,000 native species of flora and fauna of the Hawaiian Islands are thought to have evolved from about 2,000 colonizing ancestral species. The isolation that has made the plants and animals of the Hawaiian Islands unique also makes them vulnerable to rapid changes brought on by humans.

</strong></p><p>Countless times over hundreds of thousands of years, hot lava met the ocean amidst clouds of steam. Each time the island grew a little larger. Today sharks, octopi, green sea turtles, humpback whales (winter only), and fish inhabit the coastal waters of Kīpahulu. Many of the native stream dwellers in the Hawaiian Islands were originally ocean species that over time adapted to live in fresh water. The ‘o‘opu (gobies), bottom fish with frog-like faces, spend their adult lives in streams. After adults spawn, the eggs are washed out to sea. As hatchlings the young ‘o‘opu migrate back up to the freshwater pools where they began their lives. Suction cups (actually fused fins) on their bellies aid the ‘o‘opu in their upstream journey.<br />

Many of the native stream dwellers in the Hawaiian Islands were originally ocean species that over time adapted to live in fresh water. The ‘o‘opu (gobies), bottom fish with frog-like faces, spend their adult lives in streams. After adults spawn, the eggs are washed out to sea.

Current estimates place several hundred thousand people in the Hawaiian Islands at the time of Captain Cook´s arrival in 1778.</p><p>These people were skilled at fishing, farming, collecting, and craftwork. Management of their resources was based on mälama ‘äina (caring for the land), an ideal still alive among Hawaiians today. Successful farming, fishing, and gathering depended also on the concepts of lökahi (working together) and laulima (many hands). Lo‘i kalo (taro patches), fishing shrines, heiau (temples), canoe ramps, and retaining walls are lasting reminders of these dynamic cultural ideals.</p></p>

</strong></p><p>Approximately 1,500 years ago, Polynesian colonists sailed large double-hulled canoes on migrational voyages from the South Pacific. They navigated over 2,500 miles of open ocean using nature´s signs—stars, birds, winds, tides, and currents. To sustain themselves the Polynesians brought to the Hawaiian Islands food and medicinal plants, introducing kalo, ‘uala (sweet potato), uhi (yams), ‘ulu (breadfruit), and kö (sugar cane), as well as dogs, pigs, and chickens. Koa trees, found only on the Hawaiian Islands, provided logs for hulls of double- and single-hulled canoes. Single outrigger canoes (see left) were mainly used by lawai‘a (fishermen) to catch deepwater fish such as aku (bonito).<br />
