                                Hawaii Volcanoes National Park is the site of Kilauea crater, an active volcano currently spewing hot lava to the nearby ocean floor. The area also offers one of the most diverse ecosystems in the world with tropical rainforests, being home to rare birds, plant life, and endemic life found nowhere else in the world, to wide open barren lava fields showing the first signs of life.  Hawaii Volcanoes National Park has been named an International Biosphere Reserve and a United Nations' World Heritage Site. Historically, the indigenous native Hawaiians practiced their religion at this site in honor of Pele, goddess of fire and volcanic eruptions.

The Thurston Lava Tube located a short walking distance from the overlook, provides a short tour through a wet and fern filled tube with rainwater dripping from the ceiling.  The Chain of Craters Road travels from the rim of the crater down to the barren seashore near the lava flow pouring into the the ocean, forming an underwater island off the coast of southern Hawaii. Other attractions include short day hikes across cooled lava flow areas such as the Ka'u Desert and a car drive up one lane road to a lookout at 6662 ft. on the largest Volcano, Mauna Loa.

Rituals involving giving thanks for the land and its abundant resources were centered around the active volcano area. Volcanoes National Park was among the first areas to be a designated site on August 25th, 1916.

The active Kilauea Crater is still sending hot molten lava and provides a dramatic experience for visitors to sense what a real life volcano is like. The 32 million year evolution of life has created over 110 uniques species of birds, 1,100 plants, 1,000 sea animals, and 10,000 insects and spiders.

Two drive in campsites are available near the visitors center on a first come, first served basis. Driving excursions include a trip to the oceanfront along the 19-mile Chain of Craters Road and a lookout on Mauna Loa. Wilderness camping trips are available on designated trails starting along the ocean (Puna Coast Trail), visitors center near the main Kilauea Crater (Ka'u Desert Trail), and up to the summit of Mauna Loa where cabin can be reserved and another cabin (Red Hill) for the journey to and from the top.

Volcanic gas is like smog so keep car windows closed when entering areas exposed to gas clouds. If the air irritates you or causes difficulty breathing then leave the area immediately! Beware of strong winds and strong surf along the coast. No campfires throughout the park, with the exception of the fire pits at Nāmakanipaio Campground and Kīpukapuaulu Picnic Area.

<br />
Local weather at Kīlauea's summit (4000' elevation) varies daily and may be rainy and chilly any time of the year. Temperature varies by elevation. At the summit of the volcano, temperatures may be 12 to 15 degrees cooler than at sea level. The coastal plain at the end of Chain of Craters Road, where lava crossed the road in 2003, is often hot, dry, and windy with the possibility of passing showers.<br />

Start your visit at the Kīlauea Visitor Center located just beyond the park's entrance station. The park is open 24 hours a day, year round. Kīlauea Visitor Center is open daily from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.. Here, you will receive the latest information on trails, ranger-led activities, road conditions, and safety precautions. Because of the dynamic nature of the two active volcanoes in the park, conditions can change rapidly.<br />

When conditions permit, a drive down to the "End of the Road" offers visitors an opportunity to view excellent examples of the slow advance of lava across the coastal plain. These flows are characteristic of pāhoehoe on relatively flat terrain at a great distance from its vent.<br />
Presently, the Chain of Craters Road is 18.8 miles (30.3 km) to the end of the road with an elevation change of about 3,700 ft. (1,127.8 meters). Chain of Craters Road begins off of Crater Rim Drive, 3.3 miles or 5.3 kilometers south of Kīlauea Visitor Center.<br />
No food, water, or fuel is available along the Chain of Craters Road. Vault-type toilets are available at Mauna Ulu parking area (3.5 miles from the Crater Rim Drive junction) and at the end of Chain of Craters Road.

(38 meters) deep and was formed about 200 years ago. During the 1974 eruption of Keanakāko‘i, a fissure opened east of the forested Lua Manu Crater. The lava flow entered into the crater filling it with about 50 feet (15m) of lava, however about two-thirds of this lava later drained back into a fissure that cut its east crater wall. The "high lava mark" is still visible on the crater wall. This lava flow also crossed the Chain of Craters Road. Lua Manu Crater is generally considered to be the uppermost crater along the Chain of Craters in the upper east rift zone. Lua Manu Crater was formed when lava drained from the lava chamber beneath the surface, creating a void. This void caused the surface to collapse. The crater rim has no tephra (cinder, ash) deposits on the rim, thus indicating that there was no eruption or explosive event in its forming.

Hilina Pali Overlook is approximately 2,282 ft (695.6 m) in elevation and over 12 miles (19.3 km) long. The last lava flow in this area was about 650 years ago.<br />
On the drive down the Hilina Pali Road, you will see native ‘ōhi‘a trees and native underbrush. On the left side of your drive, about .9-3.5 miles (1.4-5.6 km) down, you will view the Koaʻe Fault. The Koaʻe fault is known as a "reversed or backward fault" (upper section/wedge, between rift zones and caldera, slips down into the void, therefore inland facing fault scarp/pali called Kulanaʻokuaiki). The Koaʻe fault lies between the east/southwest rift zone of Kīlauea Volcano. This fault is about 10 miles (16.1 km) long, 1.5 miles (2.4 km) wide and 50 ft. (15.2 meters) high.<br />
The fault extension was created by the slippage of the ground between the northern and southern parts of Kīlauea. It is separating about 0.5 inches (12.7mm) –3.0 inches (76.2mm) per year.<br />
Note: Hilina Pali is the largest scarp on the south flank of Kīlauea. It's very windy most of the time.

In November of 1973 there was an eruption that lasted 31 days, creating the present crater floor. This eruption also opened a fissure east of the crater towards Puʻuhululu. This fissure eruption became a phase of the 1969-1974 Mauna Ulu eruptions. The last eruption of Pauahi occurred in 1979 for 16 days.<br />
There is a short boardwalk for viewing the crater and landscape, a photographic moment. Just left of the boardwalk, you will see a fissure that poured lava in the crater during the 1973 eruption. A rampart (a cinder and ash hill) was also created during that eruption.<br />
Pauahi Crater is culturally significant and religious to many of the Hawaiian people. At times you may view a "Hoʻokupu" (offering wrapped in Tī leaf), which should not be touched or disturbed.

(121 meters) high from its pre-eruption base. At present Mauna Ulu Crater is approximately 100 ft. (30.5 meters) deep. It erupted in several phases from May 24, 1969 to July 22 of 1974.<br />
Mauna Ulu recorded high fountaining of 1770 ft. (539.5 meters);only second to Kīlauea Ikiʻs record making 1900 ft. (579.1 meters) fountaining.<br />
From 1969 to 1974 the Mauna Ulu lava flows covered 17 square miles (44 sq. km), traveled 7 miles (12 km) to the coast and covered several areas with 25 ft. (7.6 meters) deep lava.<br />
From the parking lot, there is a short lava walk to view many "lava tree molds". It really is a sight to see; mother nature at her best.

This fissure eruption covered the portion of the Chain of Craters Road that created this stop.<br />
By being adventurous, you can walk around and view several lava tree molds and a big cinder field that was created during this lava flow. Prior to this eruption, this area was a dense forest.

The lookout is also a great place for a picnic lunch and excellent photographic area.<br />
In this ahupuaʻa (ancient land division) was formerly a village on the coast, most likely destroyed and abandoned after the 1868 earthquake and tsunami, then buried by the Mauna ulu flows of 1969-1974. The Mauna Ulu flow created approximately 210 areas of new land. The ‘a‘ā lava flow appears as dull black and the pahoehoe lava flow appears as silver-grey.<br />
This overlook and exhibit sits on the crest of the Hōlei Pali (cliff). Hōlei Pali is part of a system of faults escarpments along which the coastal area has moved downward relative to the east rift zone of Kīlauea volcanoes. The last major movement of theses cliffs occurred during the massive earthquakes in 1868 and 1975 (magnitude 7.2).

It is the largest petroglyph field in the State of Hawaiʻi. Puʻu Loa is geologically dated between 1200-1450A.D.<br />
There are more than 23,000 petroglyph images, mostly "pukas" (cupules), about 85% of the total, in which a portion of the umbilical cord of a newborn was placed to ensure long life. Motifs of circles, other geometric designs, as well as cryptic designs of human representations known as anthropomorphisms, canoe sails, and even feathered cape motifs.<br />
A lava walk of 1.5 miles (2.4 km) round trip to the boardwalk will be a great experience for all. Pu‘u Loa is a "volcanic pressure dome" that was formed during the eruption of Kāne Nui O Hamo about 550 years ago.

At present, the sea arch is about 90 ft. (27.4 meters) high. The creation of this sea arch was within the last 100 years.<br />
This beautiful formation has a limited life span. The sea arch will eventually crumble and will no longer be a feature of the park. However, another will replace it as the cliff slowly migrates inland.<br />
This impressive sea arch was cut into the cliff of an ancient lava flow, about 550 years ago. The term used in the creation of this sea arch is "differential erosion", which is the difference in the hardness of various layers of lava flow.
