Edison personified the age of invention, America’s new frontier in the late 1800s. Though he was best known for the phonograph and incandescent lamp, perhaps Edison’s greatest invention was a new way to invent: the industrial research and development laboratory. Today his largest lab complex is preserved at Thomas Edison National Historical Park. With his teams of scientists and technicians, he perfected his phonograph and developed motion pictures, a nickel-iron-alkaline storage battery, and many other devices and technologies. Edison earned 1,093 U.S. patents in his lifetime, most for inventions that came from here.</p>

A three-story building held a research library, machine shops for building models, space for experiments and various research projects, and Edison’s office. Across from the main building were separate labs for chemistry, physics, and metallurgy. Though Edison was the guiding force behind every project, a spirit of camaraderie prevailed among the 100 or so employees. Small teams worked independently on aspects of projects while Edison made the rounds daily to fine-tune, offering inspired ”guesses” that usually turned out to be right. He spent most of his time at the labs, often working overnight and indulging in quick naps in his library.</p><p>Edison the inventor was also a shrewd entrepreneur who established dozens of companies during his career. ”I always invented to obtain money to go on inventing,” he said. The business side of his operation centered on the phonograph. His factories in West Orange produced a variety of cylinder and disc phonographs and recordings, plus a business phonograph for office dictation. He introduced motion pictures, and manufactured cameras, projectors, and films. In the Black Maria, the world’s first movie studio, his staff filmed everything from ballet to boxing. The phonograph and film businesses capitalized on consumer demand for new forms of entertainment.</p><p>Well into old age Edison was trying new things: a technique for poured concrete buildings, a fluoroscope to view x-ray images, methods for manufacturing large quantities of chemicals, huge machines for extracting iron from ore and for manufacturing cement. His final search was for a domestic source of rubber. Thomas Edison died in 1931. The West Orange labs soon closed, but reopened as a museum in 1948. Edison National Historic Site was established in 1962; in 2009 it became Thomas Edison National Historical Park. The park is a memorial to the man and a place where you can discover the roots of American inspiration and innovation.</p>

Edison’s 1879 lamp sketch to the left and a reproduction lamp on the right. Handwritten at the top of the sketch is, quote “Experiment No. 3.” The outline of the bulb with a point on top is in the center of the sketch. Within the center of the bulb are two loops representing the filament. On the top third of the bulb is a line with a small loop, which looks like a needle piercing the bulb, with the eye of the needle and thread on the outside of the bulb. Midway down the bulb are two handwritten words too small to read. The filament is attached to a tube within the neck of the bulb. A squiggly line is drawn on either side of the tube within the neck. It goes on either side and across the front of the tube.</p><p>The image to the right is a replica of the original light bulb. The bulb is clear with a point on top. The horseshoe-shaped filament can be seen through the bulb. The bulb fits into a wooden pedestal with two brass knobs, located on either side of the pedestal’s round base. Around the perimeter of the base is a brass plaque with wording too small to read.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>Collection of the Henry Ford</p><p><strong>Text:&nbsp;</strong>Using carbon filaments in a glass-enclosed vacuum, produces practical incandescent light powered by electric generator.

The left image is a cardboard cylinder case about five inches tall with a light colored background and brown base. The words which alternate between red and gold say “Edison Gold Moulded Records, Echo all over the world.” Laying on its side is a hollow cylinder tube about five inches tall made of an early form of plastic. It is dark in color. Around the rim of the cylinder facing the camera are words which are too small to read, but would have indicated the musician and the name of the song.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>National Park Service / JANE S.

                                <p><strong>Photo description: </strong>There are two color photographs side by side. To the left is a picture of an electric siphonator. The siphonator is half coffee pot half tea pot. It is square in shape made of copper. It is in an art deco design. The main square siphonator&nbsp;has two black handles on either side in the shape of ears. The lid is on top of the siphonator and has a black square knob for the handle of the lid. On the bottom third of the siphonator are two spickets. Both have black levers to dispense the coffee or tea. The entire siphonator sits&nbsp;on a copper base shaped like a pyramid with a flat top.</p><p>Next to the siphonator is an advertisement about the Edicraft line of products and what you could make with the appliances. At the top of the advertisement is a small profile picture of Thomas Edison. Under his portrait is the word Edicraft and under that the headings, “Table Cookery - Newest and smartest of home arts...”&nbsp;</p><p>There are three photos of Edicraft appliances, a toaster, a waffle maker and asandwich maker. Each has a description which is printed to small to read. The toaster is a rectangular box made of metal placed on the narrow side which opens at the top. You put the toast inside and close the box. The toaster is shown open. The waffle maker is open with a waffle inside. The appliance produces a six sided waffle. The sandwich maker is a fore-runner of today's panini maker. The lid closes with a hinge instead of pressing straight down on the sandwich.&nbsp;</p><p>At the bottom of the advertisement is the word Edicraft and there is also a coupon to small to read at the very bottom of the ad.</p><p><strong>Photo caption:&nbsp;</strong>In the nineteen twenties, the Edicraft division of Thomas A. Edison, Incorporated began making coffeemakers (above), waffle irons, sandwich grills, and toasters. These ”electric servants”, a popular term for kitchen appliances, fit in with notions of modern American domestic life. Sales of the pricey gadgets dropped during the Great Depression. Edicraft ceased production in 1934.</p><p><strong>Sources:&nbsp;</strong>COLLECTION OF THE HENRY FORD and &nbsp;National Park Service / THOMAS EDISON NATIONAL HISTORICAL PARK</p>

                                <p><strong>Photo description:&nbsp;</strong>The top half of this side of the brochure is covered with a modern color photograph of the exterior front facade of the Edison home at Glenmont. It is a 29 room Queen Anne style mansion with three stories, an attic and basement. It is painted a reddish color which matches the brick work on the first floor of the house. The second and third floors are made of wood with different patterns. There are dark green awnings on all of the windows and a portico covered with green bushes. On the left side of the house you can see a large glass enclosed conservatory. Trees in fall colors surround the house.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>National Park Service / Jane S. Hanna</p><p><strong>Text:&nbsp;</strong>In 1886 Thomas Edison married Mina Miller, the 20-year-old daughter of a wealthy Midwestern manufacturer. According to family lore, Edison gave his fiancée the choice of a townhouse in New York City or a home in the country. They soon settled on the Glenmont estate in Llewellyn Park, a fashionable neighborhood that advertised ”Country Homes for City People.”</p><p>The 29-room red brick and wood mansion was built in 1880 by an office clerk who spared no expense, including funds embezzled from his firm. The architect was Henry Hudson Holly, who also designed Edison’s nearby lab complex. The exterior of the house exhibits the hallmarks of the American Queen Anne style, which Holly introduced to the nation, asymmetrical facade, high-pitched gables, rooftop balcony, wraparound porch, and unified color. Interior elements include stained glass windows, chandeliers, wainscoting, and hand-painted ceilings. Expansive grounds, a greenhouse and potting shed, barn and stables, and poured-concrete garage complete the estate.&nbsp;</p><p>Glenmont was very much Mina’s domain; in fact Thomas sold the property to her in 1891 to avoid possible seizure by creditors. Mina referred to herself as a “Home Executive” and took those duties very seriously. She managed money, oversaw the servants, and raised the couple’s three children, Madeleine, Charles, and Theodore and Edison’s three children from his first marriage, Marion, Thomas Jr., and William.&nbsp;</p><p>Because Edison spent most of his time at the labs, Mina represented him in the community and by hosting social events at Glenmont. Guests included Orville Wright, Helen Keller, the King of Siam, and Edison’s friend Henry Ford. Products of Edison’s labs and factories, phonographs, kinetoscopes, and of course electric lights, were displayed throughout the rooms, as were Edison’s many honorary gifts and awards.&nbsp;</p><p>After Thomas died in 1931, Mina married again and lived at Glenmont until her death in 1947. Mina and Thomas are buried side by side in a simple plot behind their home.</p>
