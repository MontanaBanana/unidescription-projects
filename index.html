Swimming beaches and walking and biking trails beckon you today.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>                                                <div>

You can get a sense of how quickly the land is diminishing at the Marconi Station Site at Wellfleet, where the peninsula is only a mile wide. Much of the high cliff has eroded since Guglielmo Marconi first built his towers there in 1901. Cape Cod Bay’s shoreline changes, too, but not as noticeably. Great Island is now connected to the peninsula and can be explored by trail. Native people began living on the Outer Cape about 10,000 years ago. Oral tradition and a vast archeological record tell us of their history here. The Pilgrims arrived in 1620 and stayed briefly before sailing across the bay to Plymouth. Later, residents constructed buildings that reflected the sea’s influence on their lives.</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> In the middle section of the printed brochure following this text are two rows, each with three photographs.

The water way opens up into a larger area at the top left. To the top right, a wooden boardwalk extends over the marsh to a small wooden pier that extends out in the water. On the front side of the pier, a small white wooden boat is tied, sitting half in the water, and half on the bank. The entire scene is surrounded by dark green woods with a variety of trees.

The roof for this part of the building comes to a point in the center of building and above the windows. Below the center point of the roof is a framed shuttered window.</p><p>Behind this section of the building on the left side is a rectangular tower that extends up two additional stories. The tower has a pointed shingle roof. Two windows are right below the roofed area. This section of the tower is like a cap that has some trim around it. Below these two windows on the right is another window. Next to it on the left, is the framing of a window, but it is unclear of it has glass within the frame or is shuttered. The same is true for a frame below it.</p><p>Attached and to the right of the tower is another main section of the building. It is higher than the front portion of the building but lower than the tower. A single brick chimney is on the far right of the roof which slopes towards us.</p></div>

The ocean is calm, and small foamy waves roll on shore, just about ankle high. The beach is a mixture of coarse sand, and small pebbles, and is covered with the footprints of previous travelers. The first man is carrying his fishing pole at his side angled forward. The second man has his fishing pole resting against his shoulder, angled back. The sun is setting out of frame, silhouetting the two men, and casting a golden glow upon the sky, water, and the sand. In the lower right foreground, bits of long beach grass are seen but are slightly out of focus. <strong>Photo credit: </strong>© Greg Probst.<br></li><li><strong>Illustration caption: </strong>Piping plovers. <strong>Illustration description:</strong> A black and white drawing of six short squat sea-birds. Two birds are in flight, coming in from the left, and landing on a beach where four more birds stand. They are medium colored, with dark wing and tail tips, light colored breasts, and white and black collars around their necks. The beach is a mixture of sand and small pebbles. To the far left, some beach grass blows in the wind. <strong>Illustration credit:</strong> National Park Service/ Dorothy Michele Novick.</li></ol><br>                                    <div>

The map includes southeast Massachusetts, and the entirety of Cape Cod, including the national seashore. The map is oriented with north at the top and shows an area of approximately 900 square miles. <br></p><p>Cape Cod is shaped like a flexed arm, starting in the southwest, extending east, and then curving up to the north. The six towns that make up the seashore from south to north are: Chatham, Orleans, Eastham, Wellfleet, Truro, and Provincetown. The Provincetown area in the far north is in the shape of a fist in a flexed arm.</p><p>The main routes to get to Cape Cod are Massachusetts Route 3 from the Boston area in the north, and Massachusetts Route 25 from the south. Both routes converge on U.S. Route 6, which runs the entire length of the cape, ending in Provincetown in the north. U.S. Route 6 is the main access road to all destinations in Cape Cod National Seashore.</p><p>The purpose of this map is to show the major routes to the seashore.

                                                                                            <p>A map of Cape Cod National Seashore takes up the majority of side two of the brochure. The map shows the entire park including main and secondary roads, all twelve of the hiking trails, six seashore beaches, two visitor centers, picnic areas, restrooms, concessions, wheelchair accessible areas and the six towns that are inside the seashore. The map is oriented with north at the top and covers about 500 square miles. The seashore has approximately 40 miles of beaches, marshes ponds and uplands. Driving from the southern end to the northern end takes about sixty miles.</p><p>Cape Cod is shaped like a flexed arm, starting in the southwest and heading east (where the bicep and upper arm would be) and then turning north (where the bent elbow, forearm, and closed fist would be). This map shows the area from where the cape turns north at the elbow all the way to the fist. As the cape extends north in the forearm section, it begins to taper and then ends in a wider fist-like section at Provincetown.&nbsp;</p><p>Within the inside area of this flexed arm are Provincetown Harbor, Cape Cod Bay, and Cape Cod Canal. Below, on the south side of the landmass is Nantucket Sound. To the east of the Seashore’s land mass is the Atlantic Ocean. The authorized National Seashore boundary extends about a half of a mile into the ocean all along the seashore’s eastern border.&nbsp;</p><p>The seashore is located in six towns, moving from south to north, with U.S. 6 being the main road connecting the towns and the seashore. Chatham is the furthest south at the elbow area of the landmass. There, the seashore is contained within the outer beaches. All of the beaches in Chatham are operated by the town.&nbsp;</p><p>Orleans is the next town moving north. The seashore is also contained within Orleans’ outer beaches and operated by the town.&nbsp;</p><p>Eastham is north of Orleans and has several points of interest. The Salt Pond Visitor Center, which is open year round, is located here, as is the scenic lookout known as Fort Hill, which overlooks the Nauset Marsh. Eastham has two beaches, Coast Guard Beach in the south, and Nauset Beach in the north. Coast Guard Beach is wheelchair accessible and has beach wheelchairs available on a seasonal basis. The iconic Nauset Light is located right next to Nauset Beach, and is open seasonally.&nbsp;</p><p>Wellfleet is north of Eastham, and is where the park headquarters is located. Wellfleet has one beach, Marconi Beach, and is also home to the Marconi Station Site, where Guglielmo Marconi sent his first wireless transatlantic transmission. Both Marconi Beach, and Marconi Station Site are accessed by the entrance to the park headquarters area. In addition to the seashore-operated beach, the town of Wellfleet operates four additional beaches.&nbsp;</p><p>North of Wellfleet is the town of Truro. Truro features several town beaches, the seashore-operated Head of the Meadow Beach, the Truro Hostel, which is open in the summer, the Highlands Center, Highland Light, which is open seasonally, and Pilgrim Heights which boasts a picnic area, and several hiking trails.&nbsp;</p><p>Provincetown is located at the far north of Cape Cod, where the fist of this landmass would be. It is a mostly National Seashore operated area. The Province Lands has two beaches, Race Point Beach, and Herring Cove Beach. Herring Cove Beach is wheelchair accessible, has beach wheelchairs available seasonally, and features a snack bar. The Province Lands area also features Cape Cod's second visitor center, the Province Lands Visitor Center. This is located on Race Point Road, about half-way between U.S. 6 and Race Point Beach.&nbsp;</p><p>Cape Cod National Seashore's longest bike trail, the Province Lands Bike Trail, is also here and can be accessed from the Beech Forest parking lot, the Province Lands Visitor Center, Race Point Beach, and Herring Cove Beach. The North District Ranger Station is also located at Race Point Beach.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Map credit:</strong> National Park Service</p>                                    <div>
