                                                                                            <p>The difference is immediately apparent. Rock spires, ramparts, and crags that bear no resemblance to the nearby foothills dominate the landscape here. Massive monoliths, sheer-walled canyons, and boulder-covered caves define millions of years of erosion, faulting, and tectonic plate movement.&nbsp;</p><p>

Rising out of the chaparral-covered Gabilan Mountains, east of central California’s Salinas Valley, are the spectacular remains of part of an ancient volcanic field. One third of this field lies 195 miles to the southeast. Does this seem impossible? It is part of the story of the San Andreas Fault Zone, which runs just east of the park, and of the forces that have shaped this landscape for millions of years. It is the story of heat, frost, water, and wind wearing away rock. Fault action and earthquakes also account for Pinnacles’ talus caves, formed when boulders fell into deep, narrow gorges and lodged between the rock walls. These boulders form ceilings and areas of darkness, enticing visitors and many species of bats. Pinnacles’ topography is not all spires and crags. Much of the park consists of rolling hills that range in elevation from 824 feet along Chalone Creek to 3,304 feet atop North Chalone Peak.&nbsp;</p><p>

Pinnacles was proclaimed a national monument in 1908. A national park since 2013, it includes over 26,000 acres—much of which is designated wilderness. The park protects natural and cultural features, recreational opportunities, and open space in an increasingly urban setting.&nbsp;

</p><p>Pinnacles is a place for rejuvenation. People come to appreciate the unspoiled wilderness, hike the trails, climb rock walls, explore quiet caves, stargaze in clear night skies, and picnic or camp in the shade of ancient oaks. Please help us continue the work of previous generations and preserve Pinnacles National Park for future visitors.

</p><p><br></p><p>ASSOCIATED TEXT:</p><p>Stewardship in Action </p><p>Pinnacles National Park is a nesting area for the California condor and is one of a few release sites in the United States and Mexico. Loss of habitat, shootings, and poisoning from lead bullets—in gut piles or lodged in animal carcasses that the bird feeds on—led to its listing as an endangered species in 1967. An aggressive captive breeding program in the 1980s and ‘90s increased its chances for survival. One of the largest birds in North America, the condor weighs about 20 pounds and has a wingspan of 9½ feet. It soars on thermal updrafts at speeds of 55 miles per hour and altitudes of 15,000 feet. You may see condors flying over the high peaks at Pinnacles.</p>                                                <div>

These plates are always moving, some diving under others (subduction), others grinding past each other along fault zones.&nbsp;

</p><p>Our Pinnacles story began millions of years ago when the central part of the Farallon plate subducted under the southwestern part of the North American plate, creating California’s Coast Range and spawning volcanic activity. After the central Farallon plate’s subduction, the Pacific plate collided with and wrenched off a chunk of the North American plate, creating the San Andreas Fault Zone. Molten rock poured through fissures that opened as plates ground against each other.&nbsp;

</p><p>The Pinnacles volcanic field—believed to be 15 miles long and 8,000 feet high—was born 23 million years ago. The volcanoes were not where the Pinnacles are now but 195 miles to the southeast (see Neenach Formation on map below). How did these fantastic rocks get here? As the Pacific plate crept north, it split the volcanic field and carried two-thirds of the Pinnacles’ volcanics with it, leaving behind the Neenach Formation. On the Pinnacles’ slow journey, the mass sank beneath the surface. In time, the power of wind, rain, and ice exposed the old volcanic field, eroded the rubble, and the Pinnacles formation was born.

The San Andreas Fault is shown dividing California. An arrow on the right side of the fault indicates that the North American Plate is moving west, while an arrow on the left side of the fault indicates that the Pacific Plate is moving north. Pinnacles National Park is immediately left of the fault, which means it is traveling north with the Pacific plate. A small inset graphic shows a globe with the Pacific Ocean and surrounding continents visible. The Ring of Fire, a string of volcanoes and earthquake sites that surround the Pacific Ocean, is marked on the map with yellow lines.

<p>ASSOCIATED TEXT:<br></p><p>Volcanoes</p><p>Fault zones are likely places for volcanoes to occur. Here the Earth’s crust is broken, allowing magma to ooze up from below the surface or gases and ash to suddenly erupt as pressure is released. Many land volcanoes are found near plate boundaries. But most volcanism—about three-quarters of all lava eruptions on Earth—takes place beneath the ocean.</p><p>Faults</p><p>
The San Andreas Fault Zone slices through 600 miles of California. Along it the Pacific and North American plates crunch past each other—one headed north, the other west. The offshore Mendocino fracture zone (above) is the northernmost extent of the San Andreas fault sys­­­­tem. The fault is part of the Ring of Fire (right), a zone of earthquake and volcanic activity partly encircling the Pacific Ocean.
</p><p>Erosion
</p><p>Erosion from weather, water, and wind is responsible for the spires and towers you see at Pinnacles today. Water—the most powerful force—erodes by seeping into cracks, freezing, expanding, and prying off flakes and chips of the brittle rock. Where the rock is weak, erosion works more quickly; stronger rock resists these forces. Over millions 
of years, these changes scoured nearly a mile of rock from the volcanoes, resulting in the distinctive rocks seen throughout the park.

Chalon and Mutsun Indians were hunter-gatherers who seasonally harvested the area’s resources. In the 1700s Spanish missionaries introduced a new religion and lifestyle but unwittingly brought diseases that almost decimated Pinnacles’ Native Americans.</p><p>Emigrants arrived next. Pinnacles soon became a destination for picnics, festivities, camping, and exploration.&nbsp;</p><p>Homesteader Schuyler Hain, who led tours of the caves for years, began a grassroots preservation campaign. Stanford University president David Starr Jordan, US Forest Service chief Gifford Pinchot, and local families joined in. Their efforts paid off in 1908 when President Theo­dore Roose­velt proclaimed these geological formations a national monument. In the 1930s the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) built trails, tunnels, and the Bear Gulch Dam and day use area. Today’s visitors join a long tradition of treasuring and preserving this beautiful national park.</p>                                    <div>

The elegant clarkia is bright pink with four spade-shaped petals coming out of the center of the flower. The California buckwheat has tiny, tightly-clustered flowers that have each have five pink and white petals. A single mariposa lily has three delicate petals that are mostly white with deep pink spots in the middle. The two bush poppies are yellow, each with four round petals. Gray mule-ears are also yellow with many petals and fuzzy gold pollen in the center and large, gray-green leaves. The sticky monkeyflower is pale orange and oddly-shaped with five fused petals of different sizes.

Caves may be closed by flooding. Portions of Bear Gulch Cave are closed seasonally to protect sensitive bat species.

The busiest times are mid-February to early June, when the weather is comfortable and the wildflowers glorious. Weekends during those months are especially crowded, and you may need to park in one of the overflow lots.&nbsp;

</p><p>If you enjoy solitude, exploring peaceful trails, or discovering wildlife, why not try something different? Visit on a weekday or off-season. Bring a picnic dinner. Hike along Chalone Creek in the moonlight. Stroll along Old Pinnacles Trail when it is raining. Watch for condors soaring on warm updrafts, woodpeckers burying acorns in the bark of gray pines, or bobcats trotting along the road.</p><p>

Would you like to learn firsthand about bats? How about seeing the Milky Way in a sky un­polluted by city lights? Ranger-led programs are available seasonally, as staffing allows (reservations may be required). Some activities are available year-round. Read park bulletin boards or contact the park about schedules.</p>                                                <div>

Wilderness is meant to protect forever the land’s natural conditions, opportunities for solitude and primitive recreation, and scientific, educational, and historical values. In wilderness, people can sense being a part of the whole community of life on Earth. Preserving wilderness shows restraint and humility and benefits the generations that follow us.

Cell phones may not work in this remote park. Don’t let your guard down when it comes to safety. Be prepared. Please follow these regulations and safety guidelines:</p><p>Carry and drink plenty of water • Wear shoes with ankle support and non-slip soles that provide good traction—especially in caves, where the rocks can be slippery. • Carry a proper flashlight for exploring caves. Small lights like penlights and cell phone lights will not guide you safely through a dark, rugged cave. • Watch where you step, sit, or place your hands. Poison oak, stinging nettles, and rattlesnakes are in the park.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay on established trails to help prevent erosion. • Green fences indicate restoration work; do not enter these areas. • Bicycles are not permitted on any trails. • Watch for pedestrians and wildlife on roads. • Feeding, approaching, or hunting wildlife is prohibited. • All plants, animals, rocks, and structures in the park are protected by federal law. This includes wildflowers, pine cones, and rocks. They are beautiful, but please leave them for the enjoyment of future visitors. • For firearms regulations, check the park website.</p><p>Emergencies contact a ranger or call 911</p></div>
