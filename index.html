                                <p>Yellowstone National Park inspires awe in travelers from around the world. New Zealand and Iceland are known for geysers, but nowhere are there as many as in Yellowstone. At the heart of Yellowstone’s past, present, and future lies volcanism. About 2 million years ago, then 1.3 million years ago, and again 640,000 years ago, huge volcanic eruptions occurred here. The latest spewed out 240 cubic miles of debris. The central part of what is now the park collapsed, forming a 30- by 45-mile caldera, or basin (see outline on large map). The magmatic heat powering those eruptions still powers the park’s geysers, hot springs, fumaroles, and mudpots. The Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River gives a deeper view of these forces: its waterfalls highlight the boundaries of lava flows and thermal areas. Rugged mountains flank the park’s volcanic plateau, rewarding eye and spirit.</p>

They give capsule advice on three parts of the Grand Loop’s figure-eight-shaped road system that connects the park’s major attractions. Maps on the back of this brochure show park facilities and services, which are also found in the gateway communities of Jackson and Cody, Wyoming, and West Yellowstone, Gardiner, Silver Gate, and Cooke City, Montana.</p><p>Ask at a visitor center for other publications to help you see and grasp the park’s significance, because park roads sample only a fraction of Yellowstone. The rest of the park is backcountry, traversed by some 1,000 miles of trails.</p>

                                <p>This collage is an illustration of wildlife that can be seen at Yellowstone National Park including (from left to right across the page) osprey, coyote, mule deer, bighorn sheep, bull elk, wolf, grizzly bear and cub, bull moose, Uinta ground squirrel, black bear, American white pelican, bison and calf, lesser scaup, yellow-bellied marmot, pika, trumpeter swans, green-winged teal, and pronghorn. The following describe each species.</p>
<p>Image 1. In the upper left corner of the collage is an osprey. The osprey (a bird) is flying towards you on the page with its wings spread. Its back is brown and its stomach is white. Prominent dark brown patches are on the end of the birds’ wrists. Its head is white and the tail has horizontal strips of brown and white.</p>
<p>Image 2. In the bottom left corner of the collage is a coyote. At about half the size of the wolf, it resembles a medium-sized dog. The coyote is barking towards the sky and facing the left of the page. Its brown-gray fur coat is shaggy across its body and tail, with thinner fur on its legs and face.</p>
<p>Image 3. To the right of the coyote is a mule deer. The mule deer’s body turns toward the left of the page and its head is turned to look at you. The deer has twig-like, 7-point antlers that split off into two branches, with large ears right below them. Its muzzle is light beige with a black tip. The overall color of the mule deer is brownish-gray, with a white rump patch and a small white tail with a black tip.</p>
<p>Image 4. To the right and overlapping in front of the mule deer is a bighorn sheep, also facing the left side of the page. The bighorn sheep is as tall as the back of the mule deer. It has brownish-gray fur with a slightly lighter nose and black tip. The horns of the bighorn sheep are very thick at the base and curl back around the sheep’s head, below the jaw, resembling a helmet.</p>
<p>Image 5. To the right of the bighorn sheep is a bull (male) elk. The bull elk is double the size of the bighorn sheep with reddish-brown fur that darkens toward the face. The bull elk is facing left with its head slightly turned towards you sounding a call. The elk has branch-like 11-point antlers that are about twice the size of mule deer antlers. The bull elk is slightly taller than the mule deer. The elk’s face and neck fur is very shaggy compared to its body.</p>
<p>Image 6. Below the head of the bull elk is a wolf. The wolf is one-third the size of the bull elk and double the size of the coyote. The wolf is facing you on the page. The wolf’s ears are perked up with its yellow eyes looking forward. It has gray-tan fur throughout its coat, with a lighter stomach and nose.</p>
<p>Image 7. To the right of the wolf are a grizzly bear and cub. The grizzly bear is three times the size of the cub and slightly taller than the bighorn sheep when on all fours. The grizzly bear is turned to the left of the page with its head turned to face you. The cub is facing the left of the page and looking down at the ground. The bears both have shaggy fur in a light brown color with light tips. Both bears have a shoulder hump with their rumps lower than their heads. Their ears are short and rounded. Their faces are rounded with a "dished-in" or concave profile.</p>
<p>Image 8. To the right of the grizzly bear and cub is a bull moose. The bull moose is facing the left of the page and is slightly taller than the bull elk with thicker, palm-like antlers with 12 points. The bull moose has a long, blunt nose with a patch of long fur under its chin. Its shoulders are as high as the top of his head, though its back continues in a steady angle downwards to its rump. Its ears are about equal in size to the mule deer and stand upright between the two separate branches of antlers.</p>
<p>Image 9. Below the bull moose is a Uinta ground squirrel standing on its back legs, holding some grasses up to its mouth. The Uinta ground squirrel is facing the left side of the page and has fuzzy brown-gray fur with very short legs and a round frame and head. Its ears are very small and rounded; it has black eyes, and a small, pointed nose. The tail has thin fur and is shorter than most squirrels.</p>
<p>Image 10. To the right of the Uinta ground squirrel is a black bear. The black bear is about half the size of the grizzly and is facing forward and looking at you. The bear has a brownish-black furry coat that is full, but sleek. The black bear does not have a shoulder hump and its rump is higher than its front shoulders. The face profile is straight and colored slightly lighter brown-black with a black tipped nose.</p>
<p>Image 11. Above the back of the bull moose is an American white pelican, a large, white waterbird. It is facing the left side of the page with its wings spread in flight. It has a long orange bill with an extendable pouch for capturing its food. Its head, long neck, and body create an S-shaped curve. Its legs are short and its webbed-feet hang below it in flight. The pelican’s long, broad wings extend out with black trailing tips halfway down, while its tail is very short and broad.</p>
<p>Image 12. To the right of the bull moose and black bear are an adult bison and bison calf, facing the left of the page. The calf is about two-thirds the size of the adult and about equal in height to the grizzly cub. The bison’s dark-brown to rust-brown fur grows longer in the head and shorter in the rump. The top of its back is higher than its head and flows straights across with its rump slightly lower. Its nose is short and has fur flowing down under its head and chin. The bison has brown horns that curve up.</p><p>The calf is about half the length of the adult, and has fur in lighter shades of rust-brown. The fur is short in the face and rump and longer in the neck and mid-section. Its face looks more elongated than the adult, due to the lack of fur hanging from its face and chin. The calf has very small horns that look like small dots with black rounded ears above its horns. Both the adult bison and calf have a skinny, short tail hanging from their rumps.</p>
<p>Image 13. Above the back of the bison and to the right of the American white pelican is a lesser scaup (a medium-sized diving duck) flying to the left side of the page. Its bill and webbed feet are a bluish-gray color with a black head, chest, and rear. Its tail feathers are a medium to dark gray from outside edges to the midsection of its tail. Its wings have two gradations of light to dark gray feathers; one from its back to its mid-wing and one from mid-wing to tips.</p>
<p>Image 14. Below the neck of the adult bison and to the left of the calf is a yellow-bellied marmot standing on its back feet turned to the left side of the page with its head looking up. The marmot is a type of groundhog, a ground dweller with a large, stocky body. It is dark brown in color with light gold fur around the neck and shoulders and down its underside. Its legs are very short and the front paws hang in front of its body. Its tail is short and fuzzy. The marmot also has long black nails on all of its feet about the same length as its toes.</p>
<p>Image 15. To the right of the yellow-bellied marmot is a pika crouched down on all fours, facing you. The pika is about half the size of the Uinta ground squirrel and is a small, egg-shaped, short-legged, and tailless mammal. The pika is a part of the rabbit or hare family, despite their similarities to mice. It also has very round ears and a light grayish-brown fuzzy body of fur.</p>
<p>Image 16. To the right of the lesser scaup are two trumpeter swans in flight toward the left side of the page. The left swan has its wings above its body, the swan on the right has its wings below in a down-stroke. Their bills are black, half of their faces are dark gray. Their bodies are primarily white feathers with tones of very light gray throughout. The swans’ black feet are tucked under their tail feathers during flight.</p>
<p>Image 17. Above the two trumpeter swans a green-winged teal is flying to the left side of the page. This duck is small in comparison to most and has a very bright-colored pattern on its head and wings. Its head has a green patch on top, rust-brown coloring underneath, and a grayish bill. Its body is primarily tones of gray with specks of white and black throughout. The tip of the teal’s wings have a green patch with a thin yellow stripe above.</p>
<p>Image 18. To the right of the bison is a pronghorn turned to the left, with its head looking straight at you. The pronghorn is similar in size to the bighorn sheep and has a light tan back with white underside and legs. Stripes of light tan and white circle its neck, while its face and horns are a medium brown. In the Illustration, the horns look like long upright ears curved inwards at the tips, but are truly horns derived of keratin.</p><p><strong>Source:</strong></p><p>ILLUSTRATION: NPS / ROBERT HYNES</p>

At Biscuit Basin, look for mineral deposits that look like biscuits. They are slowly regrowing after being destroyed by changes triggered by an earthquake. At Midway Geyser Basin, walk the boardwalk past the enormous Excelsior Geyser Crater and the park’s largest hot spring, Grand Prismatic. Firehole Lake Drive (one-way, northbound) loops off the main road to Great Fountain Geyser, Firehole Lake, and a variety of hot pools. Lower Geyser Basin features Fountain Paint Pot, where you can take a short walk past all four types of the park’s hydrothermal features. On Firehole Canyon Drive (one-way, southbound), you pass between lava flows and by Firehole Falls.</p>
<p>Roadside forests are mainly lodgepole pine. Along the West Entrance Road (west from Madison), you can see thousands of young trees that naturally regenerated after the fires of 1988. West Yellowstone, Montana, lies 14 miles west of Madison. From Madison to Norris you drive along the Yellowstone Caldera’s northwest rim and past Gibbon Falls.</p>

Visit Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest active geyser, to see its smaller eruptions. (Full eruptions are rare.) Descend into Porcelain Basin, the park’s hottest exposed area. Exhibits at the historic Norris Geyser Basin Museum explain how geysers work. The Museum of the National Park Ranger (0.8 mile north of Norris) explores this historic profession.</p>
<p>At Norris you can turn east toward the Canyon area (see next tour). Continuing north from Norris you pass Obsidian Cliff, a national historic landmark. Obsidian, a volcanic glass used for projectile points and cutting tools, was quarried here and traded across North America by Native Americans. (Collecting obsidian or other rocks is prohibited.) Upper Terrace Drive, two miles before the main part of Mammoth Hot Springs, takes you to overlooks of spectacular terraces composed of travertine (calcium carbonate). Gnarled limber pines on some dormant formations are over 500 years old. Continue to explore the terraces from the boardwalks.</p>
<p>Exhibits at the Albright Visitor Center portray the park’s wildlife and history, including the period when the US Army protected the park from 1886 to 1916. Park headquarters is in the buildings of historic Fort Yellowstone. The Roosevelt Arch and Gardiner, Montana, are at the North Entrance, five miles north.</p>

The top layer of the cross section shows the ground surface with (from left to right) a forested area, a hot spring pool, a geyser blasting, a mudpot filled with thick mud, and a fumarole blowing a thin stream of steam. Through the middle layer are channels that connect the features on the surface to the underground, which consists of a water-saturated porous rock. The channels continue down to the bottom layer, which is made up of more porous rock layers close to the heat source.</p><p><strong>Text:</strong> Surface water seeps underground, is heated by a deep source of magma, and rises as superheated water. Geysers occur when underground constrictions increase the pressure of the water until it finally erupts. Hot springs have no constrictions, so water rises, cools, and sinks. The small amount of water in fumaroles flashes into steam before it reaches the surface. Mudpots are acidic features with limited water; the acid and microorganisms decompose the surrounding rock into clay and mud.</p><p><strong>Source:&nbsp;</strong>NPS / ROBERT HYNES</p>

Three miles farther east look for waterfowl and muskrats at Blacktail Pond. Blacktail Plateau Drive, a one-way unpaved road eastbound, leaves the main road to traverse the grass and sagebrush-covered hills and forests of Douglas-fir, Engelmann spruce, and lodgepole pine. Watch for pronghorns, mule deer, and elk. In autumn the groves of quaking aspen trees turn gold. Another side road leads to a petrified redwood tree.

Hot water acting on volcanic rock created the canyon’s colors and weakened the rock, which the Yellowstone River is eroding. North Rim Drive, 1.2 miles south of the junction, leads to overlooks of Lower Falls (308 feet) and walkways along the canyon’s rim. Lookout Point has a vista of Lower Falls. Grand View gives spectacular views of the canyon. Back on the main road, drive south 1.6 miles to Brink of Upper Falls (109 feet), where you can stand beside the Yellowstone River thundering over a lava cliff. On the main road again, go 0.6 mile south to South Rim Drive and cross the Chittenden Bridge to Uncle Tom’s Point (parking area). Trails here offer close views of Upper and Lower Falls. South Rim Drive leads to Artist Point for a classic view of the canyon and Lower Falls.</span></p>

Soil here permits little tree growth, and the shrub-and-grassland valley plants are used by grazing animals—from rodents to large ungulates like elk, moose, and bison—which in turn attract associated species, from carcass beetles and butterflies to bears, coyotes, and wolves. Look for waterfowl, including white pelicans, along the river and creeks.</p>
<p>South of the valley, stop at Mud Volcano to see its array of mudpots, fumaroles, and hot springs. Three miles north of Fishing Bridge, at LeHardys Rapids you have a chance to see spawning cutthroat trout jumping the falls in June and July.</p>

In order, the other man, woman, and man are enjoying their picnic.

The men wear trousers, button-up shirts, ties, and suspenders.

It has 141 miles of shoreline and is 20 miles long by 14 miles wide. Its deepest spot is about 410 feet. Its average depth is 140 feet. Native trout generally live in the upper 60 feet—their foods rarely occur below that depth. Average August surface temperature is 60°F. Bottom temperature never rises above 42°F. Water that cold can cause potentially fatal hypothermia or hyperventilation within mere minutes.</p><p></p><p><strong>Photo:</strong> The dark blue Yellowstone Lake, with patches of light blue reflecting the sky above.

Thermal features also occur under the bay, their heat can melt ice in mid-winter. The bay results from a small volcanic eruption about 174,000 years ago. Should the water level fall just a few feet, an immense steam, (or hydrothermal), explosion could occur here. That is what created the craters now filled by Mary Bay and Indian Pond, (described above). Exhibits at Grant Village Visitor Center, two miles south of West Thumb, highlight the role of fire in Yellowstone. Fishing, boating, and backcountry use permits are available at the visitor center; you can get details there, or visit the park website, www.NPS.gov/yell.</p>

They are, ranger stations, campgrounds, lodging, food service, picnic areas, stores, gas stations (some of which have auto repair), recycling, self-guiding trails and boardwalks, horseback riding and boat launches. Medical clinics are located at Mammoth Hot Springs, Old Faithful and Lake Village.</p><p>Five smaller inset maps detail the amenities close-up in these areas. They are: 1. Mammoth Hot Springs, 2. Old Faithful, 4. Canyon Village, 4. West Thumb and Grant Village and 5. Fishing Bridge, Lake Village and Bridge Bay. All of these and other areas within the park have a visitor center,  educational center, museum  and/or an information station.  Information stations are also at the south and west entrances of the park and in the Mammoth Hot Springs area at the Albright Visitor Center, which is not far from the north entrance to the park.

The majority of the park’s territory is part of the northwestern corner of Wyoming, with portions of the park boundary crossing through Idaho and Montana. Four  national forests surround the park and Grand Teton National Park is south. Each of the eight developed areas in Yellowstone is located near a major point of interest, including Old Faithful Geyser in the Upper Geyser Basin, Yellowstone Lake, and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone River. 
</p><p>The park can be accessed from all sides and its five entrances feed into the park’s primary access route. The Grand Loop Road looks like the numeral eight and connects each of the eight developed areas of the park. &nbsp;Tracing the outline of the numeral eight, the developed area in the upper left section is Mammoth Hot Springs. Norris Geyser Basin is in the center of the left side.  In the lower left section of the eight are Madison and Old Faithful. Along the lower right part of the eight are West Thumb, Grant Village, Bridge Bay, Lake Village and Fishing Bridge. Canyon Village is at the center of the right side of the eight. Tower-Roosevelt is in the upper right section.  The five entrance roads link to the Grand Loop Road like spokes on a wheel, running from each of the park’s five entrances. Campgrounds, restrooms and other services can be accessed from Grand Loop Road; however, not all services are available year-round. Road construction and seasonal road conditions require closure of certain roads. 
</p><p>The map also includes an outline approximating the crater left by the last major eruption of the Yellowstone Volcano, called the Yellowstone Caldera. This crater is over 42 miles at its widest point. It is an irregular circular shape and is southwest of center in relation to the park as a whole. It encompasses all of the Central Plateau, most of the hydro-thermal areas in the park, and a substantial portion of Yellowstone Lake. It also encompasses the entire lower half of the numeral eight shape that makes up the Grand Loop Road
</p><p>Yellowstone Lake occupies 132 square miles of the southeastern part of the park. Grant Village, West Thumb, Bridge Bay, Lake Village and Fishing Bridge are located along the lake. The Yellowstone River flows from headwaters outside the southeast boundary, through Yellowstone Lake, and eventually out at the north entrance. The river continues on until it reaches the Missouri River in North Dakota. The headwaters of the Snake and Madison rivers are also within the park. 
</p><p>The Absaroka Mountain Range is along the eastern border of the park. The Gallatin Range is in the northwestern portion of the park. The Madison, Pitchstone and Two Ocean plateaus are within the southwest and south sections of the park.
