                                        <p>Lillian Pitt will be shown, from the shoulders up, seated in a black leather chair. 

She is in a room with white walls, next to a window with the white blinds drawn. 

A dark and metallic abstract painting hangs on the wall behind her. 

She is wearing a brownish-orange blouse, complemented by layers of necklaces.

One of those necklaces dangles a silver medallion mask that is similar in style to her earrings, which also present sculpted silver faces. 

Pitt has short black hair, flecked with gray. 

She wears rectangular glasses and faces the camera, warmly responding to the questions.</p>

                                                    <p>One of Pitt's masks is being shown, rotating 180 degrees.<br />
<br />
The mask is a painted ceramic face, representative of a stick indian.<br />
<br />
The face is half yellow and half gray, cut in two by a red diagonal stripe.<br />
<br />
It also has three hair-like extensions sprouting from its head, with the ends of each shaped like the letter P.<br />
<br />
The mask's mouth is formed into a whistling pose.</p>

                                                    <p>A close-up of Pitt's hands show she is holding a small black mask with a long beak.<br />
<br />
It has three clumps of wires, curled like shepherd's hooks, on top of its head.<br />
<br />
The eyes are empty sockets.<br />
<br />
Pitt has a decorative swirl of a tattoo on her left hand.<br />
<br />
The camera next shows close-up views of four other mini-masks: One of a fish, a fox and two different kinds of birds. <br />
<br />
They are all ceramic and colorfully painted. <br />
<br />
They generally are realistic in style but also exude a sense of natural mysticism.</p>

<br />
It's a sunny day, and the site's landmark bastion is in the distance.<br />
<br />
A montage of sights at Fort Vancouver follows.<br />
<br />
That includes a bee-attracting flower in the period garden,  <br />
<br />
architectural detail of a reconstructed building <br />
<br />
and one of the signs welcoming visitors to the historic site.<br />
<br />
Then, Pitt is shown again.</p>
